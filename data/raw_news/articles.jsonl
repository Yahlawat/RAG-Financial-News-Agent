We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members. It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group. Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back. A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia\u2019s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia\u2019s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper. Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up. While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it. In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren\u2019t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows. With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues. You can see this Q1 earnings growth in the chart below, which also shows the deceleration in the Mag 7 group\u2019s earnings growth over the coming periods. Beyond Nvidia, the earnings focus will remain on big-box retailers, with Costco coming out with results. Costco has been a true category leader, with a higher-income customer group that is loyal to the company\u2019s value offerings. Costco is better positioned to navigate the uncertain tariff environment than many other retailers. The company\u2019s U.S. business accounts for more than 70% of its revenues, and two-thirds of the merchandise in Costco U.S. is sourced domestically. Of the imported merchandise, roughly one-third of the total comes from China, Mexico, and Canada combined, and no one country is a dominant supplier. Costco is expected to report $4.25 per share in earnings on $63.1 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +12.4% and +7.9%, respectively. Estimates have inched up since the quarter got underway, with the current $4.25 estimate up from $4.24 a month back and $4.23 two months ago. Costco\u2019s earnings and revenues in the current fiscal year (ends in August 2025) are expected to increase +11.5% and +7.9% from the preceding year\u2019s levels, respectively. The company remains well-positioned to sustain this growth momentum in the following year as well on the back of mid-single-digit comp growth and growth in membership fee income in high-single digits. No doubt, the stock has been a standout performer, handily outperforming the broader market (+10.3% vs. -1.2%) in the year-to-date period. With respect to the , we now have results from 28 of the 33 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification. The Zacks Retail sector includes Costco, Walmart, other traditional retailers, online vendors like Amazon AMZN, and restaurant players. Total Q1 earnings for these 28 retailers that have reported are up +11.2% from the same period last year on +5% higher revenues, with 60.7% beating EPS estimates and only 57.1% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. As you can see above, the EPS and revenue beats percentages for these companies are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies. Concerning the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 28 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +42.6% on +8.6% higher revenues, beating EPS and top-line expectations. As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the COVID-19 lockdowns. The two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon\u2019s results (left side chart) and without Amazon\u2019s numbers (right side chart). As you can see above, earnings for the group outside of Amazon are down -5% on a +3.8% top-line gain, which points to margin pressures for the group. The Q1 Earnings Scorecard Through Friday, May 23 , we have seen Q1 results from 478 S&P 500 members or 95.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. With less than two dozen S&P 500 members still to report results at this stage, the Q1 reporting cycle has actually ended for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with just a few companies still left to report for each of the remaining 6 sectors. Earnings for these 478 index members that have reported results are up +11.6% from the same period last year on +4.3% revenue gains, with 74.3% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 63% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates for these index members in a historical context. The comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. As you can see here, the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below historical averages, with the Q1 EPS beats percentage of 74.3% comparing to the average for the same group of 78.3% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). The Q1 revenue beats percentage of 63% compares to the 5-year average for this group of index members of 71.1%. Is the Turnaround in Estimates for Real? Looking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 478 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +12.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, which would follow the +14.1% earnings growth on +5.7% revenue gains in the preceding period. The chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2025 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters. We have been flagging consistently in recent weeks that estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, as you can see in the chart below. The magnitude of cuts to 2025 Q2 estimates since the start of the period is bigger and more widespread relative to what we have become used to seeing in the post-COVID period. But you have likely noticed in recent weeks that we have been pointing to signs of stabilization in Tech sector estimates, both for Q2 as well as full-year 2025. The chart below shows how Tech sector earnings estimates for the period appear to bottom in the second half of April, but may have started coming down again. We see this same trend at play in annual estimates as well. The chart below shows the Tech sector\u2019s evolving earnings expectations for full-year 2025. We knew something was up, as the early signs of these revision trends started showing up in the data. It may be premature to say that the trend has completely reversed. But it nevertheless shows that the revisions trend has stabilized. The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis.

The tariffs imposed by his administration have pushed the average tax rate on U.S. imports to its highest level in decades, causing some investors to lose confidence in American stocks. Consequently, the S&P 500 , the best gauge for the U.S. stock market, has underperformed benchmark indexes in Asia, Canada, and Europe this year. The index has also underperformed stock markets in emerging economies like Brazil, Mexico, and many African countries. Nevertheless, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently told Bloomberg the U.S. is still the best place to invest: \"If you were to take all of your money and put it in one country, it would still be America. I mean, it's still the most prosperous nation on the planet.\" Indeed, 21 of the 25 largest companies in the world are American companies. Included on that list are Nvidia and Amazon . Here's why those stocks are smart long-term investments. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia earns about half of its revenue from the United States, but that number has trended higher in recent years because the U.S. possesses more than 60% of (AI) compute capacity worldwide. The company is the leader in data center (GPUs), chips that are the industry standard in accelerating AI workloads. Importantly, while generative AI has dominated headlines since ChatGPT launched in 2022, the AI revolution is still in its early stages. Nvidia has the hardware and software needed to develop autonomous robots and self-driving cars. \"We build technology that almost every self-driving car company uses,\" CEO Jensen Huang told analysts earlier this year. Nvidia reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in January. Revenue rose 78% to $39 billion on strong demand for data center hardware driven by the AI boom. (generally accepted accounting principles) net income increase 71% to $0.89 per diluted share The only disappointment was an 3-point decline in , but CFO Colette Kress says that figure will rebound as sales ramp this year. Importantly, Nvidia is not immune to tariffs because most of its chips are made in Taiwan. However, the extent to which the company may be impacted is unclear because the Trump administration has not finalized duties on imported semiconductors. Nevertheless, Nvidia, with help from Taiwan Semiconductor , recently started making chips in the U.S., and production will increase next year. Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 37% annually through fiscal 2027. That makes the current valuation of 44 times earnings look quite reasonable, especially because Nvidia beat the consensus estimate by an average of 10% in the last six quarters. Therefore, investors hoping to benefit from the AI boom should own shares. Amazon earns a little more than two-thirds of its revenue from the United States, but the company operates globally. It runs the largest e-commerce marketplace outside of China, it is the third-largest worldwide, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud as measured by infrastructure and platform services spending. Amazon is well positioned for long-term growth because those three markets are forecast to expand quickly in the coming years. Through 2030, online retail sales are forecast to grow at 11% annually, digital ad spending is forecast to grow at 15% annually, and cloud computing sales are forecast to grow at 20% annually, according to Grand View Research. Amazon reported solid first-quarter financial results. Revenue rose 9% to $155 billion, and net income jumped 62% to $1.59 per diluted share. But management gave cautious guidance. Second-quarter operating income is expected to land between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, which implies growth between negative 11% to positive 19%. The uncertainty is due to tariffs. Importantly, Amazon is not insulated from tariffs simply because it earns most revenue in the U.S. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimates 60% of third-party sellers have at least some exposure to China, and that Chinese sellers account for a significant portion of ad spending on the marketplace. But he also believes Amazon's global supplier network will still let the company offer online shoppers the lowest prices in many cases. Wall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 10% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look rather expensive, but analysts may be underestimating the company. Amazon beat the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 22% in the last six quarters, and I think that trend will continue as it leans on AI to boost revenue and efficiency across its business.

{"title": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Just Sold Shares of Nvidia and 2 Other AI Powerhouses and Bought Shares of This Nvidia-Backed Company", "url": "https://finviz.com/news/65590/billionaire-philippe-laffont-just-sold-shares-of-nvidia-and-2-other-ai-powerhouses-and-bought-shares-of-this-nvidia-backed-company", "source": "Motley Fool", "scraped_at": "2025-05-26T01:30:47.194067", "published_date": "2025-05-24T04:10:00", "body": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has driven stock market gains over the past couple of years, but the momentum may be far from over. Not only do analysts predict an AI market of more than $2 trillion by the early 2030s, but current activity in the space supports that. Technology companies from Meta Platforms to Alphabet have announced billions of dollars in spending to support AI projects. Data center buildout continues. And there are more AI stages to come, such as the moment of AI agents, when companies will apply AI to handle complex real-world problems. All of this is right up the alley of billionaire Philippe Laffont, who as founder of Coatue Management, focuses on innovators and invests heavily in tech companies. In fact, the biggest positions in Coatue's $22.6 billion portfolio are Meta and Amazon , each with weightings of more than 9%. So, it may seem surprising that right now, with so much ahead for AI, Laffont just sold some shares of top AI chip designer Nvidia and two other AI giants. But, at the same time, Laffont picked up shares of an Nvidia-backed company that could become the next AI powerhouse. Let's take a look at his moves and consider the potential of this newish player. Image source: Getty Images. First, as mentioned, it's important to keep in mind that Laffont isn't just dabbling in AI, but is someone who specializes in the technology sector and heavily invests in today's leaders and tomorrow's potential leaders. Laffont holds a computer science degree from MIT and went on to hone his investing skills at Tiger Management, one of the world's first hedge funds. He then became known as one of the \"Tiger Cubs,\" Tiger employees who later launched their own funds -- and he founded Coatue in 1999. It's clear that, considering Laffont's experience and investment priorities, he has his finger on the pulse of the AI market. So, he could offer investors inspiration as they look for AI stocks to buy. In the first quarter of this year, Laffont made the following moves: And what Nvidia-backed AI stock did Laffont add to his portfolio? CoreWeave , a company that in late March completed its initial public offering (IPO) and has since seen its stock surge more than 160%, bringing the company's market value to more than $50 billion. Laffont made a decent-sized bet on this player, buying 14,402,999 shares. itself was considered a flop, as the stock stagnated during its first trading session, then fell before eventually gathering some positive momentum. President Donald Trump's import tariff plans weighed on stocks -- specifically growth players -- and that created a difficult environment for CoreWeave's first trading days. Since, though, optimism about trade deals that won't weigh heavily on the economy and the support of Nvidia have helped CoreWeave stock take off. Nvidia recently said it had a 7% stake in CoreWeave as of March 31. These two tech giants are closely linked because CoreWeave's business is tied to demand for Nvidia's (GPUs). This young company offers customers access to its fleet of 250,000 Nvidia GPUs -- in fact, users can even rent access to them by the hour. So, working with CoreWeave brings customers great flexibility along with the power of Nvidia's top AI chips. This helped CoreWeave report a 420% increase in revenue in the recent quarter to $981 million. It's important to keep in mind, though, that to build up its GPU platform, CoreWeave also built up a considerable level of debt. As of the end of the quarter, current debt totaled $3.8 billion, and non-current debt totaled $4.9 billion. Meanwhile, CoreWeave must continue spending heavily to keep growth going and serve demand -- the company forecasts capital spending of as much as $23 billion this year. And CoreWeave expects annual revenue to reach $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. It's clear that for a big tech investor like Laffont, it makes sense to lock in some gains from AI giants that have been in the portfolio for a while -- and bet on a new player that's still in its early growth stages. But before you follow Laffont, it's key to consider your investment style. If you're uncomfortable with risk and prefer stability, you're better off sticking with well-established AI players -- , AMD, or Alphabet. And Laffont, too, continues to believe in their stories as they remain in his portfolio. But, if you're an aggressive investor looking for the next big AI growth story -- and you don't mind some risk and volatility along the way -- you might consider picking up a few shares of CoreWeave. Significant upside could lie ahead as the AI boom continues. Before you buy stock in CoreWeave, consider this: The analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now\u2026 and CoreWeave wasn\u2019t one of them.

Currently, Microsoft holds the title, but after May 28, I think Nvidia will take it over. What's so important about May 28? That's when Nvidia reports its first-quarter fiscal-year 2026 results (ending around April 30), and I think there will be some great news in store for investors. Image source: Nvidia. Not long ago, Nvidia wasn't even a $1 trillion company, but the massive demand for its best-in-class propelled the stock to new heights. Thanks to their ability to process multiple calculations in parallel, GPUs have been widely used in the AI arms race. This effect can be further amplified by connecting multiple GPUs in clusters, creating an ultimate computing workhorse. Nvidia's GPUs and the products that support them far outpace the competition, which is why many estimate that Nvidia's market share in the data center GPU space is above 90%. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia generated $115 billion in revenue from its data center division alone. One estimate pegged 2024's data center capital expenditure spending at around $400 billion, so it's a good estimate that about 30% of total data center costs go to Nvidia. That same estimate projected that data center capital expenditures will rise to $1 trillion by 2028, translating to just less than $300 billion in data center revenue should that projection come true. Although Nvidia's data center revenue total may not reach that high, that projection illustrates that data centers are far from being built out. This supports general observations as well, as but it hasn't reached mainstream usage levels yet. This opens the door for significant AI data center spending, from which Nvidia will benefit. This is backed up by what the AI hyperscalers have said during their Q1 reports, as these companies gave investors guidance for record capital expenditures. They've also mentioned that despite economic headwinds caused by tariffs, their buildout plans are full steam ahead. This foreshadowing leads me to believe that Nvidia will post another excellent quarter and give strong guidance for Q2. Following earnings, the stock will likely jump up, surpassing Microsoft as the world's largest company. But what will it take to create that jump? After the sharp recovery of the market over the past few weeks, Nvidia's stock is no longer at bargain valuation levels. However, it's still cheaper than where it spent most of 2024. data by , the stock has a lot of growth priced into it. For Q1, Wall Street analysts project revenue growth of 66%, slightly above Nvidia management's growth projection of 65%. However, Nvidia has a track record of beating internal and external expectations, so don't be surprised if its growth rate is above 70%. One area we know Nvidia's growth will suffer is earnings, as they had to take a $5.5 billion write-off due to export controls changing on chips meant for China. However, I think the investing community will understand why this occurred, and it shouldn't have too much of an effect on outlook, which is what the market will mostly focus on. For Q2, Wall Street analysts project guidance for 54% growth. If Nvidia's expectations come in well above that, I think the stock will react positively, leading to Nvidia becoming the world's largest company on May 29. So, I think now is still an opportune time.

That wasn't due to any fresh innovation, discovery, or major business move. Rather, it seemed to have more to do with some grand pronouncements by a single quantum company executive. Nevertheless, as a writer, I can confirm that words have power, and these were powerful enough to lift the sector as a whole. Industry standard-bearers Quantum Computing , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum all saw their share prices inflate at double-digit rates. The stocks rose a respective 15%, 24%, and 26% on the day. Those market-moving words came from the leader of one of their peers, IonQ . That morning, published an interview with the company's CEO, Niccolo de Masi, in which he waxed extremely bullish about the prospects for his business. This was clearly taken by the article's readers as likely prosperity for the wider quantum space. Image source: Getty Images. De Masi is clearly not the shy and publicity-adverse type of corporate leader, as he made a series of grand pronouncements about IonQ. In his eyes, the company is the quantum sector equivalent of graphics processing unit (GPU) king Nvidia or advanced processor specialist Broadcom . As such, IonQ's ultimate prominence and power will be imitated by businesses hoping to catch some of its magic. In fact, added the executive, \"they have always copied and followed us.\" That isn't really accurate, as the varied quantum companies currently traded on the stock market are following different paths to hoped-for success. In IonQ's case, it's a \"full-stack\" business, aiming to provide hardware, the software that runs on it, and applications for control and access. In a way, though, Quantum Computing, Rigetti, and D-Wave followers. IonQ was among the first pure-play quantum companies to become publicly traded. That pedigree is a factor that has helped drive its market cap to over $11 billion at present. That dwarfs its three peers, as the most richly capitalized of the trio -- D-Wave -- is currently valued by investors at under $5.6 billion. Nevertheless, investors should always be wary of hype, especially when applied to an early-stage industry struggling to get on its financial feet -- like quantum. While the technology has indisputably immense potential, getting a quantum business to the point where it's efficient and profitable is quite the challenge. None of the prominent quantum companies -- yes, including IonQ -- has yet to stem their often very deep net losses. There are potentially significant catalysts on the horizon. One that could change the landscape dramatically is Congress's National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Act. As the name implies, this would restart a federal program aimed at boosting quantum, with public funding for businesses actively involved in such work. Capital for cash-hungry companies on the cutting-edge of new technologies is almost always scarce; passing the act into law would alleviate that nagging and persistent headache. I have to emphasize here that such industry-boosting factors are only potential at this point, not reality. And that goes double for any talk of a single quantum company or a clutch of them becoming the new Nvidia or Broadcom. Both of these successful enterprises are the products of years of patient business development and often heavy research and development expenditure. Neither blasted into the world suddenly as cash-gushing winners. At this point, it's hard to place bets on which quantum company, or companies, will pull ahead with offerings irresistible to customers thirsty for exponential increases in computing power. Given that, it's probably a good move for quantum bulls to spread out their investments among the leading stocks in the space. I feel all of the aforementioned titles can potentially leverage the technology into robust profits eventually -- and yes, that includes IonQ, all hype and hot air aside.

Alphabet announced numerous new AI products and advances that show Google is leading in (AI), not falling behind. After years of worrying about AI disrupting the Google cash cow, the market has turned optimistic, and shares are up 5.5% for the day at 11:30 a.m. ET. Google held its I/O event yesterday and introduced a number of product enhancements like AI-mode in search, Android XR, and agent mode in the Gemini app. The company is leaning into its technology and infrastructure advantages to bear in more ways for both users and developers on Google Cloud. Google is bringing all of its products to AI. Image source: Alphabet. What's most impressive is the breadth of advances in AI, from language to video. And the company is trying to push AI into its existing products like Search and Gemini, presumably before the search business is disrupted by ChatGPT and Perplexity. While the announcements weren't financial in nature, they showed how quickly Alphabet is building product platforms that could drive financial results in the near future. Google Cloud is a growth driver today, AI in search could allow search to grow rather than be disrupted, and the expansion of Android into glasses could be another growth platform. What the market has been worried about for years is Google Search being disrupted by AI competitors. This is another data point that shows Google is innovating in AI and may be more likely to disrupt itself than get disrupted.

Investors traded assertively out of the stock following an analyst's price-target cut, to the point where it closed the day more than 9% in the red. That was a far steeper fall than the S&P 500 index's 1.6% decline. That pundit was Baird's Colin Sebastian, and before market open he changed his Reddit fair-value assessment to $120 per share, well down from his previous $140. Despite the double-digit adjustment, he left his \"neutral\" recommendation on the shares unchanged. Image source: Getty Images. The analyst's move, according to reports, was largely due to concerns about capabilities being harnessed by tech titans such as Alphabet . Not long ago, that company's core Google unit rolled out AI responses to standard search queries, and it plans to continue beefing up its AI enhancements. To Sebastian, this is a threat to Reddit's user growth, as it can obviate the need for discussion with other users -- the bread and butter of Reddit's business -- in order to obtain an answer. Mitigating this to a degree, the pundit wrote, is a data-licensing agreement in place between Reddit and Google. While that's a legitimate source of concern for Reddit investors, I don't feel it's quite a deal-breaker. We still have quite a distance to go before AI functionalities can even come close to mimicking genuine and organic human reactions, so Reddit's forum-style presentation should continue to be popular.

Investors need to look past the price they have bought them for just a month ago, as those prices are long gone. Furthermore, investors shouldn't sit on the sidelines waiting for another drop, as it may not come for some time. With this in mind, I've got three AI stocks that still look like solid buys and can make investors a great profit if they're willing to hold on to them for at least three to five years. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has been the king of AI investments since the start of 2023, and that outlook isn't changing anytime soon. have processed the calculations to train many of the AI models that we've used to this point, and although there is competition rising from custom AI accelerators that some of Nvidia's clients are designing themselves, the flexibility and computing power that a GPU provides is still unrivaled. As a result, GPUs will continue to be the computing option of choice moving forward. This makes Nvidia a stock well worth owning, and it's still not priced all that expensively compared to where it spent most of 2024. data by As a result, I think Nvidia is still a solid buy here, as many investors made a ton of money by buying and holding Nvidia's stock throughout 2024 at price points more expensive than today's levels. Taiwan Semiconductor , often referred to as TSMC, is a critical supplier of chips and produces the chips that go into cutting-edge devices like Nvidia's GPUs. Furthermore, orders at TSMC are often placed years in advance, giving management unparalleled insight into the demand for chips. As an example, TSMC's existing Arizona fabrication facility has sold out chip production through 2027, which means that it likely has orders at least through 2028 in its system. So, when management is willing to give commentary on what the next five years look like, investors should listen. Over the next five years, they expect AI-related chips to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). That's impressive growth, and is a contributing factor to the near-20% CAGR they expect companywide. Few companies of TSMC's size can put up predictable and sustainable 20% growth for a period of five years, yet that isn't priced into Taiwan Semi's stock yet. At , you're paying a market-average multiple for a company that can reliably put up market-crushing growth. data by As a result, Taiwan Semiconductor makes for a great purchase right now. Alphabet may be a somewhat controversial stock pick compared to Nvidia or Taiwan Semiconductor, as the challenges it faces are quite steep. Investors are worried about how its base Google search engine business will fare with rising AI competition and a potential economic downturn ahead. Additionally, it has been found guilty of operating two illegal monopolies, which could lead to Alphabet's breakup. This has led the market to place a cheap valuation on Alphabet's stock, as investors are worried about the future. data by At just Alphabet's stock is incredibly cheap, but does its cheap stock price outweigh the risks? I think so. Alphabet is currently juggling the traditional Google search versus AI search very well through its AI overviews feature. Furthermore, Google Search's revenue rose 10% year over year in Q1, so if AI were a problem (it has been widely available for three years now), we likely would have seen at least some effect in this area. Alphabet can't control what the broader economy does, but history tells us that the economy eventually bounces back, so the economic outlook is only a short-term headwind for Alphabet. Lastly, the government's investigation into what to do with Alphabet is completely unknown. However, breakups and spinoffs tend to unlock more value for shareholders, and it's possible that a broken-up Alphabet might be worth more than an intact one.

But the tech giant can appeal these defeats, so they aren't the greatest threat Alphabet faces. The larger risk to its business right now is artificial intelligence (AI). Consumers are flocking to AI apps such as OpenAI's , so much so that research company Gartner estimates search engines will see a staggering 25% drop in usage next year. This could cause Google's search business to collapse if the prediction comes true. AI certainly holds the potential to unseat Google's reign atop search engines. In fact, for the first time since 2015, Google's market share dropped below 90% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and was at 89.7% in April. These signs suggest cracks in Google's armor, so Alphabet must succeed at its own AI efforts if it wants to protect its all-important search business. Here's a deeper look into how the company is faring in the battle for AI supremacy. Image source: Getty Images. The AI stakes are high for Alphabet. Maintaining Google's search success is essential because this part of Alphabet's business produced $50.7 billion of its $90.2 billion in first-quarter revenue. Alphabet is determined to win at AI. The company spent $52.5 billion in last year as it built out the infrastructure needed to support its AI ambitions. It plans to up that investment to $75 billion in 2025. The expenditures involve investing in cutting-edge technology to power its AI systems, such as a proprietary Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Alphabet's TPUs are hardware specifically engineered to efficiently train AI models and boost AI inference, which is a term describing an AI's ability to apply what it has learned to real-world situations. So far, its AI investments have paid off. Alphabet began inserting AI-generated results into Google's search results nearly a year ago, and as of the end of Q1, CEO Sundar Pichai noted, \"We continue to see that usage growth is increasing as people learn that Search is more useful for more of their queries\" thanks to AI. Moreover, according to Alphabet management, Google's revenue generation remains at the same rate as before AI was introduced, which indicates the company's addition of AI didn't take away from its ability to earn income from search queries. In fact, Google's $50.7 billion in Q1 search revenue represented growth from the prior year's $46.2 billion. AI is also a central component to Alphabet's success in other parts of its operations. One of these is its business, Google Cloud. Through the Google Cloud platform, the conglomerate makes its AI tech available for other companies to use. Customers building AI through Google Cloud include Verizon Communications and Loews . Because of growth in AI adoption by other firms, Google Cloud's Q1 sales increased an impressive 28% year over year to $12.3 billion. Alphabet's AI accomplishments also extend to its self-driving car business, Waymo, which uses AI to make driving decisions. As of Q1, Waymo is providing over 250,000 passenger rides per week, a fivefold increase from the prior year. Waymo's growing popularity is another example of Alphabet's accomplishments with AI. Alphabet's AI achievements demonstrate it's succeeding with artificial intelligence. Every product the company owns -- representing at least half a billion users -- is using Alphabet's AI now. This is translating into revenue growth with Q1 sales hitting $90.2 billion, up from the prior year's $80.5 billion. And now is a good time to scoop up Alphabet shares. That's because its stock valuation looks reasonable when comparing Alphabet's (P/E) ratio to competitors Meta Platforms and Microsoft . Meta is second only to Alphabet in terms of digital advertising market share, and has also invested heavily into AI. Microsoft competes against Alphabet across the search, advertising, and cloud computing markets. Data by . Alphabet's P/E multiple is the lowest among its competitors, indicating its stock is a better value. A combination of economic uncertainty fueled by President Donald Trump's and the loss of federal antitrust lawsuits contributed to Alphabet's P/E ratio declining over the past year. Although the challenges of economic volatility and ongoing antitrust battles will persist in the short term, these are transitory, unlike the of AI that will play out over the long haul. Despite Google's search market share dipping below 90%, it still holds a massive lead over competitors. OpenAI's ChatGPT is predicted to reach 1% search engine market share this year, but that's still a far cry from Google's share. Alphabet's strategic AI investments are bearing fruit, and its relatively low valuation makes Alphabet an attractive AI investment for the .

It could unlock new ways to solve some of the world's most complex problems. Multiple companies are investing heavily in this arms race, and businesses of all sizes are vying for quantum computing supremacy. While some of the start-ups are intriguing, I prefer to focus on more established companies investing some of their vast resources into quantum computing. Two that top the list for me are Alphabet and Microsoft . Both companies have resources that other companies could only dream of, which is why I think they will end up at the top of the quantum computing arms race. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet kicked off the quantum computing investment trend in December with the announcement of its Willow quantum computing chip. It announced a breakthrough that allowed it to arrange qubits on the chip so that there were fewer errors in the calculation. This is the are facing, as quantum computing has inherent errors. Traditional computing transmits information in bits, either a 0 or a 1. There's no room for interpreting that signal incorrectly, so traditional computing isn't prone to the errors that quantum computing is. Quantum computing utilizes qubits, which transmit information as the probability of an answer being a 0 or a 1. This has its perks and drawbacks. Qubits can transmit far more information about a calculation per unit. On the downside, there is room for errors to develop because the answer isn't explicitly a 0 or a 1. Competitors have made multiple attempts to solve this problem, and each company has devised its own solution. Google's solution was to arrange the qubits in a grid-like pattern to reduce the number of errors each qubit has. Microsoft claimed to have created a new state of matter that allowed the particle to be controlled more precisely in its chip, which gave it far more accurate information. Time will tell which path is optimal, or if both are acceptable solutions to the same problem. But one thing is certain: Both companies have the resources to compete. One of the more popular pure-play investments in the quantum computing arms race is IonQ . IonQ relies on external contracts to fund the company, which it realizes as revenue. In the first quarter, IonQ's revenue totaled just over $7.5 million. For both Microsoft and Alphabet, $7.5 million is a rounding error, and they can afford to throw far greater resources at quantum computing. measures how much cash a company generates after operating expenses are subtracted. Over the past three years, both companies have hovered around the $20 billion per quarter mark, so investing $500 million or so each quarter in the quantum computing business wouldn't be that big of a deal for either company. data by This is a key factor in the AI arms race: The big tech giants can outspend the start-ups. While David and Goliath stories exist for a reason, with how much research and intense computing power are needed to get quantum computing to a usable point, I want to invest in the bigger players for quantum computing exposure. As another benefit, they still have a strong base business to lean on if either of these two loses the quantum computing arms race. If one of the start-ups loses, it's done. This all-or-nothing investment style doesn't suit me, which is why the larger players with more resources are my top picks for the quantum computing arms race.

Moreover, with demand for technologies driven by (AI) going through the roof, investors can still find AI-related stocks with significant potential for gains. When taking these factors into account, investors may want to consider investments in the three following stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Investors will likely struggle to find a company more central to AI than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , the leading manufacturer for all of the top chip companies. Although its customers design their chips, Nvidia , Apple , Qualcomm , and many others depend on TSMC (as the company is also known) to manufacture their most advanced chips. According to market researcher TrendForce, TSMC dominates its industry with a 67% market share. And it shows no signs of stopping, even as it yields to political pressure to produce more chips outside of Taiwan. The company has pledged between $38 billion and $42 billion on this year and will increase its total investment in its U.S. factories to $165 billion. TSMC's growth is so strong that it generated $26 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, a 42% increase from a year ago. That generated $12 billion in net income, 47% higher year over year, as it kept a lid on operating expenses. But TSMC sells at a of 25 despite the rapidly improving financials. That likely means a low valuation and rapid profit growth should help push the stock higher. Investors tend to think of Airbnb as a travel stock and give little thought to its AI. Nonetheless, Airbnb thrives on a strong brand identity, network effects, and a website that links interested parties who need travel accommodations with homeowners. It uses AI to perform many of the required tasks more effectively. Among these AI-driven capabilities is writing a property description based on pictures, providing customer service, optimizing pricing, and detecting fraud. These abilities allow the site to more effectively draw customers while reducing operational costs. In the last quarter, they helped Airbnb book 143 million nights and experiences, an 8% yearly increase. A sluggish economy and more-intense competition have weighed on Airbnb. Its first-quarter revenue of $2.3 billion was just an 8% increase. Also, higher spending in product development as well as sales and marketing reduced its profits. Consequently, the company earned $154 million in the first quarter, down from $264 million a year ago. Still, a sluggish stock performance has kept its valuation in check, and it trades at just 35 times earnings. That is significantly below late last year, when the P/E was just under 50. With this looking increasingly like a bargain, it could spark a recovery as Airbnb's value proposition continues to improve. Another affordable AI stock that investors seem to have overlooked in recent years is Google parent Alphabet . The company is an AI pioneer, having introduced the technology as early as 2001. But the rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI models has called Alphabet's business model into question -- the advertising that supports Google Search and other platforms was 74% of revenue in the first quarter of 2025. The company owns numerous businesses, and Google Cloud has generated an increasing share of its revenue. Moreover, a recent funding round valued its autonomous-vehicle segment Waymo at $45 billion, even though it's never mentioned in earnings reports. The recent report said that first-quarter revenue of $90 billion rose 12% compared to the same quarter in 2024. Also, reduced expense growth helped boost the company's net income, which surged 46% higher to almost $35 billion. Despite that increase, the stock fell slightly over the last year. That allowed its P/E to fall to just 19, making it the \" \" stock with the lowest valuation.

Alphabet's stock is down about 13% year to date as of this writing, as investors worry about the future impact of on its search business. However, Loeb has a different view and bought $453 million worth of Alphabet stock in the quarter. Here's why. Loeb wrote exactly why he was buying Alphabet stock in Third Point's first-quarter letter to investors. These investment letters are common in the hedge fund industry and give investors a quarterly update on a fund's investment performance. Portfolio managers will also often highlight a few investment ideas or talk about the current investing or macro environment in these letters. In his letter, Loeb told investors that he made a significant investment in Alphabet in the quarter, while acknowledging the market's worry about AI search and chatbots on Google search. He said that this concern is not entirely unfounded, but that Alphabet has advantages that are being overlooked. The first big advantage Loeb noted that Alphabet has is distribution. While he did not go into the particulars, this can be seen in several areas. First and foremost, the company is currently the default search engine on billions of devices. It provides the operating system for Android devices, which use its search engine. Android is estimated to power around 70% of the world's smartphones. Alphabet also owns the world's most widely used search browser, Chrome, where it is also the default search engine. In addition, it currently has a revenue-sharing search deal to be the exclusive search engine on Apple devices. This gives it access to another nearly 30% of the market not powered by Android. It also has revenue-sharing deals with other browsers, such as Opera . In addition, Alphabet owns one of the world's largest advertising networks. It really can't be underestimated how much time and effort the company has put into developing its local ad presence. While AI companies are still trying to figure out the best way to monetize their offerings, Alphabet can connect advertisers with consumers on everything from a global to a local level. This is a huge monetization advantage over competitors. The second big advantage Loeb said Alphabet has is technology. He noted that some initial Gemini AI model blunders caused investors to forget that Alphabet has been building out its AI capabilities for over a decade. He highlighted that a paper by Google engineers paved the way for the widespread use of , while the company has two leading AI research organizations in Google Brain and DeepMind. He believes that Alphabet is close to beginning to monetize Gemini in a meaningful way. As for the impact on Google search, Loeb envisions a world where generative AI takes content creation costs to near zero, leading to more internet content, whether it be articles, entire websites, or video. However, with this increased content, it will become more difficult and expensive for businesses to stand out and attract customers. In a world flooded with low-quality and fake AI-generated content, he thinks Google Search will become even more valuable as a source of truth. Loeb said he is also encouraged by Alphabet's recent cost discipline and how it is taking a tougher stance on employee protests. Back in 2018, Alphabet had canceled a large military AI project, Project Maven, due to employee protests -- and Palantir Technologies would take over the project as a result. Image source: Getty Images. While there is a Google search disruption risk, Loeb lays out a nice argument as to why he does not think this will happen and why Alphabet will be an AI winner. I also think it's important to note that traditionally the company only serves ads on 20% of its search queries. Even if AI shrinks overall search queries, it could ultimately make them more valuable to advertisers. At the same time, with its large ad network, Alphabet should also be able to find new ways to monetize things like AI Overviews, expanding its overall search revenue opportunities. And of course, Alphabet is also about much more than search. It also owns the most-watched streaming platform in the world and the third-largest cloud computing business. Cloud computing, in particular, has been a big growth driver for the company, and it is investing heavily to keep up with the growing demand for its services. Its robotaxi business is also growing rapidly and has the potential to be its next big business. Trading at a of 17 times 2025 analyst estimates, the stock is in the bargain bin, making it an attractive option to buy at current levels.

But AI hype has pushed up stock prices for several tech companies and inflated their valuations in many cases. Fortunately, investors looking for AI bargains can still find some. One of these is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , popularly known as TSMC, which Nvidia employs to construct its AI chips. Two others are Super Micro Computer , commonly called Supermicro, and Google parent Alphabet . Looking at the (P/E) ratio of these three AI stocks compared to Nvidia reveals that they are trading at much lower valuations at the time of writing. Data by . These three companies saw downward pressure on their share prices because of various headwinds. A big one is the global economic uncertainty introduced by President Donald Trump's . But the of AI promises to boost each company's business over the long run. Beyond their relatively cheap valuations, here's why each is a buy. Image source: Getty Images. TSMC is a compelling investment because of its leadership in manufacturing chips used to process AI tasks. Its expertise in efficiently producing 3-nanometer (nm) chips in large quantities is leading to rapid sales growth. This tech contributed 22% of the company's $25.5 billion in first-quarter revenue, up from just 9% in the prior year. Although it's seeing success with its 3nm technology, TSMC is already looking to the next step. The manufacturer is working on its next-generation tech, 2nm, which it expects to enter production later this year. TSMC's technological achievements helped it grow Q1 sales by a strong 35% year over year to $25.5 billion. Moreover, its Q1 rose to 58.8%, up from 53.1% in the previous year, demonstrating efficiency in managing costs. Although the dynamic situation with tariffs introduces possible volatility into TSMC's business in the near term, the company forecast Q2 revenue to reach between $28.4 billion to $29.2 billion. That would be an outstanding increase of at least 37% from the prior year's $20.8 billion. Also, TSMC was awarded $6.6 billion in federal government funding as part of the CHIPS Act to build semiconductor fabrication facilities in the United States. So the company is in a great position to see long-term business growth. Supermicro sells servers and data storage solutions to businesses building AI systems. The company was beset by a series of short-term issues in 2024 that sent its stock tumbling, including the resignation of its auditor, but it has since . In its fiscal 2025 Q3 (ended March 31), Supermicro's revenue reached $4.6 billion, a 19% increase year over year. Despite the growth, the result failed to meet the company's forecast for at least $5 billion in sales as customer purchasing delays pushed \"some sales into Q4 and later,\" according to CFO David Weigand. Like TSMC, the current macroeconomic climate induced by tariffs affects Supermicro in the short term, but AI's growth can buoy the company over time. After all, the AI market is forecast to expand from 2024's $184 billion to a whopping $826 billion by 2030. In fact, Supermicro estimates it will close out fiscal 2025 with sales between $21.8 billion and $22.6 billion. That would be a strong increase from the prior year's $14.9 billion. The company already exceeded the previous year's total revenue through the first three quarters of fiscal 2025 with sales of $16.2 billion. That means its revenue goal for the year is within reach. Google parent Alphabet is investing heavily in AI. The company spent $52.5 billion in last year to build cutting-edge AI systems. Today, every product the company owns with at least half a billion users has incorporated Alphabet's AI. The addition of AI to products such as Google's search engine and its business, Google Cloud, contributed to both seeing double-digit year-over-year sales growth in Q1. Google hit $50.7 billion, and its cloud division earned $12.3 billion. This performance helped Alphabet reach $90.2 billion in total Q1 revenue, up from $80.5 billion in 2024. Another example of Alphabet's AI success is Waymo, its self-driving car business. Waymo's service uses AI to make autonomous driving decisions, and now supplies more than 250,000 passenger rides per week, a fivefold increase from last year. Alphabet's stock is down not only because of current macroeconomic conditions; Google also lost two key over the past year. But the conglomerate has the opportunity to appeal the decisions, so these short-term challenges do not necessarily translate into an impact on its business. Although TSMC, Supermicro, and Alphabet face(d) headwinds that pushed share prices down, the situation has created a buying opportunity for investors with a . The AI market's ongoing expansion and the success these companies have already demonstrated with AI position these three businesses to grow in the coming years.

Billionaire Bill Ackman doesn't subscribe to the theory that he needs to own lots of stocks to be successful. His Pershing Square Capital Management holds positions in a total of only 12 stocks. Nearly one-third of Ackman's $11.9 billion portfolio is invested in three magnificent growth stocks. Ackman now has a new top stock in his portfolio. In February, he revealed via a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that Pershing Square was buying shares of Uber Technologies . Beginning in early January, we began acquiring a position in . Today, we own 30.3 million shares. I have been a long-term customer and admirer of Uber beginning when Edward Norton showed me the app in its early days. I was also fortunate to be a day-one investor in the... Pershing Square still owned 30.3 million Uber shares worth roughly $2.21 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2025. This stake in the ride-hailing services company made up 18.5% of the hedge fund's portfolio, edging out Brookfield Corp. as its largest holding. Image source: Getty Images. Ackman's X post mentioned several reasons he invested in Uber. First, the billionaire said he was \"a longtime customer and admirer\" of the company. That fits squarely into the philosophy espoused by legendary investor of buying what you know. Ackman also called Uber \"a highly profitable and cash-generative growth machine.\" Arguably, its valuation was the most important factor in his decision to buy the stock. Ackman thought Uber traded at a steep discount to its . However, since his social media post, the stock has soared. An additional 14% of Pershing Square's portfolio is invested in another technology giant. But that percentage is split across two shares. Ackman owns both Alphabet Class A shares and Alphabet Class C shares . He first invested in the Google parent company in early 2023. Many were skeptical about Google's prospects in the aftermath of OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT. Some even predicted that the technology popularized by ChatGPT presented an existential threat to Google Search. Ackman disagreed. He quickly took advantage of Alphabet's sell-off and built a large position in its two stocks. Today, the company's Class A and Class C shares combined make it Pershing Square's third-largest position. That move has paid off nicely despite Alphabet's poor stock performance in 2025. Interestingly, Ackman has both bought sold Alphabet recently. He increased his hedge fund's stake in the Class A shares by around 11.3% in Q1 but reduced its position in the Class C shares by 16.2%. Not everyone agrees with Ackman about Uber's valuation. The stock trades at nearly 32.6 times forward earnings. Its , which is based on analysts' five-year earnings growth estimates, is a sky-high 14.5. AlphaSpread's puts Uber's intrinsic value at roughly 18% below its current share price. However, calculating an intrinsic value uses many assumptions. SimplyWallSt estimates that Uber is undervalued by nearly 47%. Ackman would probably agree more with the assumptions used in that analysis than he would with AlphaSpread's. My problem with buying Uber stock right now, though, is that I'm not sure which assumptions are closer to being right. What about Alphabet? The company faces some uncertainties, especially with the antitrust rulings that have gone against it. But I like Google Cloud's growth prospects with the rapid adoption of generative AI. I like the potential for Alphabet's self-driving car business, Waymo (which has partnered with Uber, by the way). I also predict that Google Search will continue to integrate with AI to improve its capabilities and hold on to the massive user base that attracts advertising revenue. Overall, I view Alphabet as the best pick in Ackman's portfolio.

In simplest terms, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. It's an infrastructure-as-a-service model where customers can pool resources, such as processing power and storage, and are able to scale their usage up and down quickly. It is attractive to many organizations because they don't have to buy and maintain their own servers and storage systems. Cloud computing is a high-fixed-cost business that benefits from economies of scale. When these businesses achieve enough scale to cover their fixed costs, they then see a lot of operating leverage, where their profitability growth greatly exceeds their revenue growth. While there has been a continued shift of organizations moving from on-premise solutions to the cloud, the advent of has really kick-started strong growth for the sector. The reason is that customers are using cloud computing services to customize foundational AI models or create their own models and apps, and then run their AI workloads through their infrastructure. Image source: Getty Images. While not without risks, this is a huge megatrend that is benefiting several companies. One risk would be overbuilding data center capacity that does not get used, although some cloud providers have argued that the bigger risk is underinvesting and falling behind. Let's look at three no-brainer ways to play the cloud computing trend. Amazon created the cloud computing industry following its own struggles to scale its infrastructure needs, and today it is the largest cloud computing service in the world, with nearly a 30% market share. While best known for its e-commerce operations, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment is both its largest by profitability and its fastest growing. Last quarter, AWS revenue rose 17% year over year to $29.3 billion, while operating income climbed 22% to $11.5 billion. AWS' growth is being powered by its Bedrock and SageMaker solutions. Bedrock lets customers tap into top AI foundation models from both Amazon as well as third parties, which they can then customize for their own needs. SageMaker, meanwhile, gives users the tools to build and train their own models from the ground up. Amazon, through its Annapurna Labs division, has also built its own custom AI chips to power its cloud business. Its Trainium chip is designed to train large AI models, while its Inferentia chip is built to run AI . Custom chips are more efficient and use less power than mass-market , giving Amazon a cost advantage. While AWS remains the largest cloud computing business in the world, Microsoft Azure has been gaining market share in the space. Azure revenue has climbed by 30% or more for each of the past seven quarters, including by 33% last quarter, bringing its market share to around 22%. The company's partnership with leading AI foundational model company OpenAI has helped set it apart. Its platform gives direct access to OpenAI's leading AI models, so that customers can integrate them securely into their applications. It's also embedded OpenAI's models throughout its ecosystem, including with its popular GitHub code repository that is run on Azure. Microsoft is now looking to branch out. It began hosting models from Elon Musk's xAI, and it hired the co-founder of DeepMind to start developing its own AI models. While this move carries some risk, diversifying its AI portfolio and forging its own AI path should be a big opportunity. While some investors worry about the impact of AI of its search business, there is no denying that AI is helping power Alphabet 's cloud computing division, Google Cloud. The smallest of the big three cloud computing businesses, with about a 12% market share, Google Cloud has recently reached a profitability inflection point. This could be seen in its first-quarter results, when Google Cloud revenue climbed 28% year over year to $12.3 billion, while its segment operating income surged 142% to $2.2 billion. Like its competitors, the company benefits from the growing demand for AI services. The company's Vertex AI machine learning platform, analytics tools like BigQuery, and leadership in Kubernetes help set it apart. Google developed Kubernetes to run and automatically manage apps on containers, which are software packages that bundle apps with everything they need to run. Vertex AI, meanwhile, is Google Cloud's end-to-end machine learning platform that lets customers easily build, deploy, and manage AI models. Alphabet has also developed one of the most advanced foundation AI models with Gemini, which Google Cloud customers can fine-tune for their own custom models and apps. With the help of Broadcom , it has also developed its own custom AI chips to help lower costs. Now, notably, search is still the largest part of Alphabet's business, and some investors fear it is getting disrupted by AI. However, I think investors are overlooking the distribution (Google is the default search engine for most devices and browsers) and network (its ad network can reach anything from a local to a global audience) advantages it has. Meanwhile, Google Cloud looks poised to just grow bigger and bigger.

After all, Alphabet 's Waymo is currently on the road in several cities, with some analysts concluding that it has already overtaken Lyft in areas of San Francisco where Waymo operates. Meanwhile, Tesla 's service is set to launch next month in Austin, Texas. This will be a huge deal for both Tesla's and Alphabet's shareholders, as many believe Tesla will be the eventual winner in the space. However, the launch will be of absolutely massive importance to Tesla shareholders, as the bulk of Tesla's valuation appears tied to this autonomous robotaxi opportunity. Thus, next month's launch will have huge consequences for Tesla's stock. But will Tesla really dominate this emerging industry? Image source: Getty Images. Tesla is set to officially launch its autonomous robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. In a recent CNBC interview, Musk gave a very bullish outlook on the new service, saying he believed that by the end of 2026, there would be hundreds of thousands, if not a million, Teslas doing self-driving in the United States. That appears to be an astronomical amount, given there are only a bit over 1,500 Waymos on the roads today in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin. Of course, Musk was discussing not only robotaxis but also existing owned Teslas equipped to use the company's full self-driving software. It should be noted that while Waymo is given very little credit as part of Alphabet's stock value, a huge amount of Tesla's valuation rests on the self-driving robotaxi opportunity. After all, Tesla's stand-alone auto sales are struggling. At the beginning of 2023, revenue growth started to decelerate, and that negative momentum has recently snowballed into outright revenue declines. Last quarter's deliveries were down a whopping 13%, and trailing-12-month earnings per share have more than halved. data by . EPS = earnings per share. Needless to say, these results alone, with earnings of $1.82 (and falling) over the past 12 months, clearly do not justify a stock price anywhere close to $334 as of this writing. But Tesla bulls such as Cathie Wood believe Tesla can become a multibagger mainly on the back of the autonomous robotaxi opportunity. Wood's firm, Ark Invest, published an analysis of Tesla last year, valuing the stock at a whopping $2,600 per share. However, the rub of that ambitious price target is that Ark believes 90% of that future value will come from autonomous robotaxis, not car sales. That's because Ark believes autonomous robotaxis will be a massive market and that Tesla will dominate. This is likely due to the belief not only in Tesla's full self-driving technology but also in its cost advantages over potential competitors. This is where the Tesla bull case potentially has legs. According to Elon Musk, Tesla's costs per operating mile for its self-driving fleet are 20% to 25% of Waymo's. This is due to the higher cost of Waymo's sensor suite, which includes cameras, lidar, and radar, versus Tesla's camera-only approach, as well as Tesla's mass production capabilities. That analysis has also been reflected by other analysts, such as artificial intelligence (AI) analyst James Douma, who noted the biggest cost differential between the two services was the depreciation on the vehicle and sensor hardware. With a cost advantage, Musk believes Tesla can achieve up to 90% of the autonomous driving . While estimates for the autonomous robotaxi market vary widely, some analysts put the opportunity as high as $450 billion by 2033. For Cathie Wood's part, Ark estimates Tesla's robotaxi revenue will reach between $600 billion and $950 billion by 2029. That would likely amount to a huge market share of a big market in just four years' time. The danger for Tesla investors is if next month's initial rollout doesn't go as well as expected or its robotaxi service isn't as superior to Waymo's as many think it will be. The first danger, obviously, is if there is a safety issue. Keep in mind that Waymo had its initial robotaxi trial all the way back in October 2020 in Phoenix. So, Waymo had a five-year head start on Tesla before it carefully and methodically expanded to San Francisco, Los Angeles, and then Austin. As of last month, Waymo was making 250,000 rides per week, with each ride adding to its driver's intelligence and reputation for safety. While Tesla's clearance for its Austin launch shows Tesla has proven its safety bona fides to some extent, investors really won't know how safe it is until it gets its robotaxi service on the road. In another CNBC interview on Wednesday, Waymo CEO Tekedra Mawakana appeared to question how Tesla's camera-only approach would perform at night, implying that Tesla's cameras may miss things that Waymo's radar and lidar sensors would pick up in extreme darkness. Furthermore, Waymo's higher costs aren't fixed at today's levels -- they're also set to decrease. In an interview with Business Insider last week, Waymo's first CEO, John Krafcik, said that in the long run, sensor costs will come down and ultimately be a \"trivial\" portion of Waymo's total cost per mile. Instead, the bigger cost is that of producing vehicles, which Waymo currently buys from Jaguar in low volumes. This is in contrast with Tesla, which already has established, vertically integrated mass manufacturing. But just announced on May 5 that it's opening a new autonomous vehicle factory for its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Phoenix, Arizona. The new autonomous plant will produce another 2,000 vehicles this year, more than doubling the 1,500-vehicle fleet already on the road. The company also said the new plant would eventually scale up to tens of thousands of Waymo riders per year, which should drive down costs per vehicle. With Waymo's current momentum, five-year head start, and improvements to its mass manufacturing on the way, Tesla is under a lot of pressure to deliver when it unveils its robotaxi service next month. Keep in mind, Tesla's initial service will comprise only 10 to 20 vehicles. However, that will still be an important starting point for both and Alphabet investors to begin monitoring the unfolding robotaxi battle for the months and years ahead.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On May 21, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers reiterated an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the stock with a $185.00 price target. Rakers noted that Nvidia\u2019s NVLink Technology has growing potential, particularly after the launch of NVLink Fusion. The technology allows third-party custom silicon and CPUs to integrate NVIDIA\u2019s memory-coherent NVLink for chip-to-chip interconnect. While some industry reports do suggest that this CPU connectivity isn\u2019t something novel, Rakers stressed the role of NVLink interconnect in AI infrastructure. NVIDIA\u2019s NVLink interconnect offers significant bandwidth advantages over the standard PCIe. In particular, the NVLink version 6, anticipated to be launched in the second half of 2026, is expected to double the bandwidth to 3.6TB/s with Rubin R200 GPUs. Rakers also highlighted how Nvidia is enhancing its competitive edge through its move to externalize NVLink. It is doing so by enabling its Grace and Vera CPUs to connect with custom accelerators and CPUs. Initial partners for the venture include Marvell, Alchip, MediaTek, and Astera Labs, with Synopsys and Cadence. Overall, NVDA on our list of AI stocks that are making waves this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Here's What the Evidence Suggests.", "url": "https://finviz.com/news/64762/should-you-buy-nvidia-stock-before-may-28-heres-what-the-evidence-suggests", "source": "Motley Fool", "scraped_at": "2025-05-26T01:30:47.249178", "published_date": "2025-05-23T03:02:00", "body": "Advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have taken the world by storm over the past few years, but much of the initial hype has since subsided. Investors are looking for evidence that the adoption of AI still has legs. Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs) quickly became the gold standard for training and running models. The company generated five consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue and profit growth, but as its growth rate began to decelerate, investors got nervous. The company is scheduled to release the results of its fiscal 2026 first quarter after the market closes on Wednesday, May 28, and shareholders -- and indeed Wall Street at large -- will be sitting on the edge of their seats for clues as to where AI goes from here. Let's review the company's most recent results, see what the available evidence suggests about the company's future prospects, and whether Nvidia stock is a compelling opportunity ahead of its highly anticipated financial report. Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. Image source: Nvidia. For its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 26), Nvidia reported revenue of $39.3 billion, which soared 78% year over year and 12% sequentially. Strong sales drove robust earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89, which surged 82%. Lest there be any doubt, it was the continuing adoption of AI that fueled the results, as revenue in its data center segment jumped 93%. Nvidia expects its strong growth to continue. For its fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 28), management is guiding for revenue of $43 billion, which would represent growth of 65%. Wall Street is equally bullish, with analysts' consensus estimates calling for revenue of $43.15 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.73. While this would mark a minor deceleration compared to last quarter's robust sales performance, it would be remarkably strong nonetheless. Nvidia has a long history of issuing conservative guidance, so the actual results could well be higher. The popular narrative suggests the rapid buildout of AI-centric data centers by the major cloud and tech companies is showing cracks, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet 's Google Cloud, the \"Big Three\" in cloud computing, have announced plans to boost infrastructure spending this year. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of that spending is earmarked for additional data centers to support demand for AI. Not to be outdone, Meta Platforms has already announced plans for higher capex spending than it originally envisioned. The totals are intriguing: As the world's foremost provider of processors used for AI, Nvidia is well-positioned to capture a significant part of this data center spending from the four horsemen of tech. There's more. The Trump administration recently rescinded the so-called \"AI Diffusion Rule.\" The strict set of export curbs initiated by the Biden Administration was designed to keep U.S. adversaries from using AI against our national interests. Critics complained the rules were strict and threatened to stifle innovation. Rescinding this rule opened the floodgates, resulting in a host of new AI chip deals for Nvidia. For example, the company announced a partnership with Saudi Arabian company Humain. Nvidia will immediately supply more than 18,000 GB300 Grace Blackwell processors -- its most advanced AI chips -- for the country's data center buildout, with plans to eventually ship \"several hundred thousand.\" The deal also includes Infiniband networking technology solutions, which provide ultra-fast processing combined with low latency. This helps illustrate the vast opportunity that remains for Nvidia. Make no mistake, Nvidia remains extremely volatile, but it's hard to deny the company's long-term success. Over the past three years, the stock has gained 688% (as of this writing) but has also fallen as much as 35% -- so it isn't for the faint of heart. This helps illustrate one of the surest paths to investing success: Buy stocks in the best businesses you can find and plan to hold for three to five years. The biggest question on the mind of investors is whether Nvidia stock will rise or fall following its highly anticipated financial report, and the truth is I have no idea. In fact, anyone who professes to know what will happen in the days or weeks to come is not being completely honest. If I were to prognosticate, I would feel comfortable making several very vague predictions: Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine, and my predictions could be dead wrong. That said, nothing about my investing thesis for Nvidia has changed. The company's state-of-the-art GPUs are the gold standard for AI processing, and it continues to dominate the market. There's always the chance someone will create a better mousetrap, so to speak, but the specter of competition is always a factor. The majority of experts believe we're still in the early stages of AI adoption. Most estimates place the AI market size at a minimum of $1 trillion, with some estimates suggesting it could eventually be 10 to 15 times higher. Nvidia stock currently sells for roughly 30 times forward earnings, with its valuation recently rebounding from a two-year low. However, the company's history of innovation, industry-leading position, and long track record of growth give me confidence the best is yet to come. For investors who believe that AI is still in the early innings and Nvidia will continue to lead the charge, buy Nvidia stock and buckle up for the bumpy -- yet potentially lucrative -- ride ahead.

But as with any technology that comes along, investors will need to watch for companies that fail to live up to the hype. This is where following the stock picks of billionaire investors could prove very helpful. These investors have had successful investing careers, and they generally don't invest in a company until they have completed exhaustive research into its competitive position, risks, and return prospects. Fortunately, billionaire fund managers are required to report their holdings on every quarter. The latest round of 13Fs revealed prominent billionaires still buying shares of two high-flying chip stocks in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the leading chip manufacturer in the world. It controls more than 60% of the global foundry market, as it makes chips for leading chip companies, including Nvidia . Growing demand for chips used for in data centers has helped send the stock up 279% over the past five years, and its run may not be over. Three notable billionaires were buying shares in the first quarter. David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital, and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management were adding to their firm's stakes. The company's strong first quarter amid uncertainty over the economy is pointing to tremendous momentum in the AI market. Demand for AI chips remained robust in the first quarter. Revenue and grew 35% and 60% year over year, and TSMC is making significant investments in expanding capacity to support long-term demand. TSMC recently unveiled its A14 logic process technology, representing a step forward from its current 2-nanometer (N2) process. The A14 delivers a 15% increase in performance with a 30% power savings over the N2 and is scheduled to enter production in 2028. These billionaires are making a bet that TSMC is benefiting from sustainable demand in the AI market. They are obviously aware of the 's historical cyclicality, and some of that cyclical nature revealed itself last quarter, as not all the markets that TSMC sells into are experiencing strong demand right now. For example, seasonal softness in smartphone demand caused TSMC's revenue to fall 5% over the previous quarter. It also experienced a small setback in chip production following a recent earthquake that disrupted operations. Over the long term, the increasing use of more technologically advanced devices and data centers for AI should create opportunity for TSMC. The growing need for more advanced chips is why the stock has delivered market-beating returns over the last decade, and it could repeat that performance. TSMC forecasts AI chip sales to double in 2025 and grow at an annualized rate of 40% through 2028. Considering this forecast, the stock looks compelling, trading at a reasonable 21 times this year's earnings estimate, while analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 21%. Image source: Nvidia. TSMC's long-term outlook for AI chip sales bodes well for Nvidia. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in the AI chip market. The stock has rocketed 1,400% over the past five years, yet a few billionaires still see upsides. In the first quarter, Chase Coleman added to his firm's stake, while Daniel Loeb of Third Point established a new position in the stock. Nvidia is coming off an incredible year, where its revenue more than doubled to $130 billion. Based on a strong outlook for Nvidia's new chips going into production, analysts expect the company's revenue to increase by 53% to nearly $200 billion in the current fiscal year. Its new Blackwell computing platform designed for the most advanced AI workloads is already raking in billions in revenue, and the company is racing to raise supply to meet demand. Even Nvidia's automotive chips for self-driving cars are seeing strong demand, with revenue expected to triple this year to $5 billion. One risk for Nvidia is companies pursuing cheaper alternatives than buying its GPUs. Some of Nvidia's customers, including Amazon and Alphabet 's Google, have invested in their own chips for AI. Custom chip solutions can perform more efficiently at specific computing tasks and save money over Nvidia's general-purpose GPUs that can cost tens of thousands of dollars per unit. Coleman and Loeb are obviously betting that data centers will continue to need Nvidia's GPUs. With Nvidia's software, companies can tailor these GPUs to work with a number of use cases. Nvidia just made a flurry of announcements at the recent Computex conference that show its GPU technology becoming more entrenched in companies' AI investment plans. For example, Nvidia and Microsoft are working together on agentic AI, an advanced form of AI that can make decisions without a human prompt. Perhaps the most important announcement from Nvidia was the introduction of NVLink Fusion, which will allow customers to integrate chips from other chipmakers alongside Nvidia's GPUs in data centers. This strategy could ultimately expand the addressable market for Nvidia's chips, while protecting its lead in the AI market. Despite these positive developments, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30, which seems on the low side for a company that analysts expect to grow earnings at a 35% annualized rate. Given , the stock could hit new highs this year and still deliver market-beating returns over the next few years.

We've had no shortage of earnings reports from influential businesses, a Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, and countless updates on tariff and trade policy from President Donald Trump and his administration. But amid this sea of data, perhaps nothing has been more telling than the filing of with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to file a 13F with the SEC. This filing allows professional and everyday investors to see which stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Wall Street's leading asset managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter. May 15 marked the filing deadline for 13Fs detailing trading activity for the March-ended quarter. Image source: Getty Images. Though , he's far from the only billionaire fund manager known for outsized investment returns. Third Point's billionaire chief Dan Loeb also has quite the following on Wall Street. Loeb closed out the first frame of 2025 with $6.55 billion in AUM which was spread across 45 stocks. But what's particularly noteworthy about Loeb's investing style is his penchant for buying and selling high-growth and widely owned companies. Based on Third Point's latest 13F, Dan Loeb completely kicked North America's kingpin Tesla to the curb and chose to pile into Wall Street's preeminent artificial intelligence (AI) stock. Although Dan Loeb completely exited nine positions at Third Point during the first quarter, including social media colossus Meta Platforms , the sale of 500,000 shares of Tesla is what stands out most. The reason? and tacked on an additional 100,000 shares in the December-ended quarter. Between Jan. 1 and March 31, something changed. This \"something\" could very well be Tesla's soaring share price. In the wake of President Donald Trump's victory in November and CEO Elon Musk being designated as a \"special government employee\" for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Tesla stock very briefly doubled. The average stock in Loeb's portfolio has an average hold time of a little over 13 months, so he's not shy about locking in profits. But . To begin with, there's growing concern that Musk's involvement with DOGE and his numerous other companies and projects are detracting from Tesla's growth potential. Despite continued sales growth from Tesla's energy generation and storage operations, EV revenue plunged 20% in the first quarter from the prior-year period. Moreover, Tesla's vehicle margin has been trending lower for the last two years. Musk noted during his company's 2023 annual meeting that . A slew of sweeping price cuts for Tesla's fleet (Model's 3, S, X, and Y) confirms that competition is picking up and/or demand for EVs has waned. Even with steep price cuts, Tesla has struggled to keep its EV inventory levels from rising. Another concern is that . Companies with first-mover advantages should be generating their profits from their products and services. More than half of Tesla's pre-tax income can be traced to automotive regulatory credits, which are given to it for free by governments, and interest income earned on its cash. Without automotive regulatory credits, Tesla would have reported a pre-tax loss in the March-ended quarter. Lastly, Dan Loeb might be out due to . For instance, Tesla's chief has claimed that Level 5 full self-driving is \"one year away\" for the last 11 years. He also expected 1 million robotaxis on American roadways \"next year\" in 2019. The cherry on top is that demand for Cybertruck has been well below the initial hype. If these unfulfilled promises are backed out of Tesla's valuation, its stock could have a long way to fall. Image source: Getty Images. On the other end of the spectrum, Third Point's 13F shows that Loeb opened 10 new positions during the first quarter. Though he did add a handful of high-yield dividend stocks, such as telecom titan AT&T and consumer health products company Kenvue , which isn't unexpected given the volatility we began witnessing in the stock market late in the first quarter, Loeb's eyebrow-raising purchase is premier AI stock Nvidia . The last time Third Point's billionaire investor held shares of Nvidia for his fund was the second quarter of 2023. He then sold what's now the equivalent of 5,000,000 shares of Nvidia during the third quarter of 2023, which . During the first quarter of 2025, Loeb scooped up 1,450,000 shares, which are currently valued at almost $196 million. No company has been a more direct beneficiary of the AI revolution than Nvidia. Its Hopper graphics processing units (GPUs) and Blackwell GPU architecture are the . Essentially, Nvidia's hardware is the brains behind generative AI solutions and the training of many large language models (LLMs). Nvidia has also been able to take full advantage of AI-GPU scarcity. Even with world-leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Nvidia can't come close to meeting the full demand for its hardware. When demand for a good overwhelms supply, it's perfectly normal the price of that good to climb. Both Nvidia's Hopper and Blackwell GPUs are commanding a premium to competing chips, which has been a benefit to the company's gross margin. Even the CUDA software platform is doing its part to make Nvidia one of Wall Street's most-influential businesses. CUDA is the toolkit developers use to maximize the compute potential of their Nvidia GPUs, as well as build LLMs. More importantly, it's an anchoring tool that's helping to keep clients loyal to Nvidia's ecosystem of products and services. The final piece of the puzzle for Loeb looks to be Nvidia's valuation, which has become considerably more palatable. During the tail-end of March, Nvidia's dipped to around 19, which appears quite inexpensive given the growth rate it's been able to sustain. But Nvidia stock isn't guaranteed to head higher. Every next-big-thing trend for more than three decades . The simple fact that most businesses lack a well-defined AI game plan and aren't generating a profit on their AI investments signals that investors have, once again, overestimated the adoption rate and utility of another game-changing technology. Competition is a genuine concern, as well. As both , AI-GPU scarcity will diminish. Ultimately, this is bad news for Nvidia's AI-GPU pricing power and its margins.

Let's look at two terrific tech stocks to start buying now with a $1,000 investment. Image source: Getty Images. Chip giant Nvidia remains the best-positioned company to continue to benefit from the buildout. Its have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, providing the computing power needed to run AI workloads. The company's dominance in the GPU space can be seen in its over 80% market share. While the company's chips are top-notch, what has really set it apart and created a wide moat is its CUDA software platform. It created the free software platform to allow developers to be able to program its chips for purposes beyond their original intent of helping speed up graphics rendering in video games. Since then, it has built a collection of libraries and tools on top of its platform called CUDA X that helps bolster the performance of its chips for AI tasks. The company sees demand for its GPUs coming from multiple areas. The biggest is in the space, where the big three providers are aggressively building out data centers to keep up with the demand stemming from customers looking to customize AI models and run AI workloads on their systems. In addition, companies that build foundation AI models, such as Meta Platforms and xAI, have also been building out data centers, while OpenAI is part of the Stargate Project, a consortium that plans to spend $500 billion on data centers over the next few years. Enterprises have also started to increase their on-premise data center spending as they look to deploy hybrid cloud models for AI. At the same time, countries have also begun to invest in AI infrastructure. For example, on his trip to the Middle East, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a big AI infrastructure investment from Saudi Arabia. When looking at risks, the biggest one Nvidia faces is if AI infrastructure spending begins to slow. The company does not have a recurring revenue stream like a software company, so it relies on increased demand for its chips. Right now, though, it appears that AI infrastructure spending is poised to continue to ramp up. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, with a of under 31 times this year's analyst estimates and a 0.6 , with numbers below 1 considered undervalued. One tech stock that has been tossed in the bargain bin this year is Alphabet . While the company has continued to post strong revenue and earnings growth, investors remain concerned that AI is going to disrupt its main search business. Alphabet's Google search engine has a dominant position in search, with an approximate 90% global market share. However, there is no doubt that AI chatbots are gaining momentum and beginning to become more mainstream. While they have their flaws, there are many things that these AI chatbots do well, and they can answer more complex questions better than a search. But Google Search doesn't make much money from searches involving things like helping students with a biology paper or helping someone design a workout routine. Historically, it has only served ads on about 20% of its queries and makes money from searches with a commercial intent. As such, when the company recently introduced its new AI Mode for search, it came with clear ways to improve upon inquiries with commercial intent. This included agentic capabilities, where it can search across platforms to present you with the best ticket prices from sites like Ticketmaster and StubHub for a concert or sporting event. Need to research a summer camp for your child with specific criteria and distance from your home? It can do that. It also has a Shop by AI Mode that can find items based on your description, let you try on outfits virtually using an uploaded photo of yourself, and even track prices for items you are interested in. In addition to its often-overlooked strength in AI, Alphabet has some big advantages that tend to get ignored. Between its Android smartphone operating system, Chrome browser, and revenue-sharing deal with Apple to be the exclusive search engine for Safari, the company is the default search engine on most devices connected to the internet. It also has the world's largest advertising network, and its reach in local markets around the globe is difficult to replicate. As such, in what is ultimately a two-sided marketplace of consumers and advertisers, Google has been able to entrench itself on both sides. So, despite the inroads that Perplexity and ChatGPT have made, Google still has a solid moat. With a forward P/E of only 17.5 times, Alphabet stock is cheap. Investors also get a lot more than Alphabet's search business. They get its fast-growing cloud computing business, a rapidly expanding robotaxi business in , and the most watched video streaming service in the world with YouTube.

With roughly 12.8% of Navitas shares sold short before the announcement and a market cap still hovering around $886 million as of this writing, this explosive move has triggered a mix of excitement and skepticism among investors. Image source: Getty Images. The question now is whether this rally has staying power -- or whether investors have already missed the moment. The answer may depend on understanding not just what happened, but why it matters for the future of AI infrastructure. Read on to find out more. The Nvidia partnership isn't window dressing -- it positions Navitas at the center of one of the most ambitious infrastructure overhauls in AI history. The collaboration involves replacing today's antiquated 54V power architecture with a revolutionary 800V HVDC standard capable of supporting IT racks of 1 megawatt or more. To put this in perspective, current data center infrastructure maxes out at a few hundred kilowatts per rack. Nvidia's next-generation \"Kyber\" rack-scale systems, powering graphics processing units (GPUs) like the upcoming Rubin Ultra, will demand unprecedented power density. The shift to 800V HVDC isn't just an upgrade -- it's a complete rethinking of how power flows through the digital backbone of AI. Why does this matter? Because power delivery is quickly becoming the bottleneck for AI expansion. As compute requirements explode, traditional power systems are hitting physical limits. Nvidia's projections suggest the shift to HVDC could improve data center power efficiency by 5%, cut copper use by 45%, and reduce maintenance costs by up to 70%. For hyperscale operators managing thousands of racks, these improvements translate to millions in operational savings. Navitas' gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors are central to delivering this transformation. Its GaNFast and GeneSiC technologies enable the high-frequency switching and thermal efficiency required for 800V systems -- capabilities that traditional silicon simply cannot match. What sets Navitas apart isn't just its technology -- it's the company's integrated approach. While competitors focus on individual components, Navitas has developed complete power system solutions. Their recent demonstration of an 8.5 kW AI data center power supply achieving 98% efficiency isn't just impressive -- it's production-ready. The company's GaNSafe power ICs (integrated circuits) include integrated protection features that traditional discrete solutions lack. Meanwhile, its GeneSiC silicon carbide devices utilize proprietary \"trench-assisted planar\" technology that delivers superior performance and reliability. The magnitude of the stock's move wasn't driven by fundamentals alone. As of the latest report, 12.8% of Navitas' float was sold short -- an unusually high level for a small-cap tech name. This situation created a powder keg waiting for a catalyst. can be violent and brief, and the rally from under $2 to nearly $5 in a single session reflects a technical unwind as much as a fundamental repricing. The high short interest suggests many investors had written off Navitas as another struggling semiconductor company. The Nvidia announcement forced a rapid reassessment. But here's what makes this different from typical short squeezes: The underlying catalyst has substance. This isn't a meme stock rally driven by social media hype -- it's a fundamental shift in how one of the world's most important technology companies approaches power infrastructure. Despite the excitement, Navitas' financials still demand caution. The company generated approximately $83 million in revenue in 2024 but posted a net loss of nearly the same amount. The bottom line is that the path to consistent profitability remains unclear without significant design wins and volume ramps. That's not surprising given the large short interest, and this Nvidia news doesn't immediately change the situation. Navitas remains a speculative stock, but the asymmetric upside has sharpened considerably. The Nvidia partnership validates both the technology and market opportunity while providing a credible path to scale revenue. A market cap under $900 million leaves substantial room for revaluation if the collaboration leads to broader industry adoption. What's the investing takeaway? Navitas has suddenly moved from obscurity to center stage in the next phase of the AI infrastructure build. The stock may give back some of its recent gains as momentum fades, but the company's opportunity has suddenly expanded in a way that's impossible to ignore. That said, this small-cap tech stock should still be viewed as a high-risk, high-reward option on the larger AI infrastructure build.

For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment. Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way. However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta. Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance. Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns. Because the fund has amassed over $460.30 million, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Blend. QLC is managed by Flexshares. QLC, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust Quality Large Cap Index.

These tools, including new models for humanoid reasoning, motion, and skills, may contribute to what CEO Jensen Huang has described as the \" next industrial revolution ,\" made possible with physical AI and robotics. As is often the case when NVIDIA makes moves in the direction of a particular technology, investors have turned their attention in response to a number of other firms working in the area of robotics . While NVIDIA is one of a number of involved in the development of hardware or software necessary for the advancement of robotics, investors keen on the potential for this technology can also turn to smaller, dedicated companies that may have stellar growth potential. Two names in particular, and , might be worth considering for those bullish on robotics as a field. Serve Robotics is known for its self-driving delivery robots, which provide food delivery services throughout the United States. Through a partnership with which it spun off from in 2021, Serve achieves a key advantage over other delivery services in its ability to complete the so-called \"last-mile\" challenge . It's easy to imagine Serve's purview, which includes a host of other delivery and logistics tasks. Serve is undergoing a tremendous scale-up , so it's understandable that losses have been mounting. In the latest quarter, the company deployed 250 of its newest generation of robots and aims to have a fleet of 2,000 by the end of 2025. So far this year, Serve has increased its daily supply hours by 40% over the final quarter of 2024, boosting delivery volume by more than 75% from the first week of the latest quarter to the last. It has also more than doubled its household reach since December while dramatically increasing its merchant partnerships. Revenue remains low at $440,000 for the latest quarter, though this marks a 150% sequential improvement on a quarterly basis. Serve also expects second-quarter revenue to grow sequentially at a 35% to 60% pace. Overall, Serve is rapidly expanding and building a desirable niche in a new segment of a popular industry. Investors may hesitate at the significant discrepancy between the company's revenue and its net losses, but the firm did end the first quarter with a record $198 million in cash on hand. This should provide it ample room to continue to build out its operations. It's no surprise, then, that have given them a Buy rating . The stock also has a consensus price target of $19.50 , nearly double the current price levels. Richtech Robotics creates robots to automate the service industry, including for delivery, cleaning, and other applications. Its products are designed for use in retail spaces, restaurants, hotels, casinos, medical facilities, and more. Richtech has recently begun to shift from robot sales to a new robots-as-a-service (RaaS) model, expanding its addressable market to a size of roughly $230 billion . The company achieved 400 customer installations as of the latest quarter and aims to increase that figure by 150% by 2026. The growing labor shortage in the service market provides a gap that Richtech seeks to fill with its robots and robot services. The company sees its robots being usable for up to 80% of jobs across the service industry. For the trailing four-quarter period through the end of March of this year, Richtech reported $4.4 million in revenue and $6.5 million in secured RaaS contracts, as well as nearly $32 million in cash reserves on hand. However, the latest earnings report was lackluster, as the company missed earnings forecasts and recorded its widest-ever net losses. The company also faces dilution due to warrant exercises. Combined, these make Richtech a riskier investment than Serve. Still, the firm has garnered Buy ratings from both analysts reviewing its stock, as well as upside potential of about 39%.

Along the way, it split its stock for the second time this decade and the sixth time overall since going public in 1999. Companies often outperform the market after splitting their stock, and that was the case for Nvidia after its most recent stock split. But the tech giant has slowed down quite a bit in 2025. It has been volatile, like many major tech stocks, and its share price is down 3% year-to-date at the time of this writing. Is another stock split in the cards to boost Nvidia's share price? Here's what to expect and a look at Nvidia's recent results. Image source: Getty Images. I won't keep you in suspense -- I highly doubt Nvidia will split its stock in 2025 or 2026. The primary benefit of a is that it lowers a company's share price, which makes investing in that company seem more affordable. \"Seem\" is the operative word here. The number of outstanding shares increases, but the company's overall value doesn't. If a company is trading for $1,000 or $2,000, some investors will likely think twice about investing because of how much it costs to buy in. It's not a huge barrier, now that many brokers let investors buy , but a lower share price can help increase the appeal of a stock. After Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split on June 10, 2024, it went from a share price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. For new investors, especially those on a budget, it's much easier to buy a stock for $120 than for $1,200. Nvidia's value has gone up by 10.2% since its stock split. Since the share price has only changed a relatively small amount, another stock split doesn't serve much of a purpose. has been one of the biggest winners as tech companies have increased spending on artificial intelligence (AI). Revenue has grown for eight consecutive quarters, and by a sizable amount -- it reported $130.5 billion in revenue for its 2025 fiscal year, up 114% year over year. About 88% of that revenue comes from data centers and the graphics processing units (GPUs) that Nvidia develops for them. While data centers now make up a dominant portion of Nvidia's business, it's also a leader in gaming GPUs and reported $11.4 billion in revenue from that segment during its 2025 fiscal year. In addition to its revenue growth, Nvidia is a highly profitable company. for the 2025 fiscal year was an impressive 75%, and its net income of $72.9 billion was a 145% year-over-year increase. Nvidia has its next quarterly earnings report on May 28, and it has consistently surpassed analysts' expectations in recent years. There may not be a stock split on the horizon, but a positive earnings report is even better. Most importantly, Nvidia is doing well financially because of the strength of its business. Demand for GPUs has skyrocketed since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia is the leading GPU company, including gaming GPUs and the most advanced AI GPUs. The global GPU market is projected to keep growing, with Arizton Advisory & Intelligence estimating it will go from $70 billion in 2024 to $237.5 billion in 2030. Given Nvidia's dominant position, it will almost certainly take a large slice of the market's growth. The biggest challenge Nvidia is currently facing is the effect of tariffs and a potential U.S.-China trade war. It already reported that it will take a special charge of about $5.5 billion this quarter for exporting H20 processors to China and other locations. And Nvidia manufactures its products in countries that were hit with high tariff rates, although they've been lowered for the time being. In response to the tariff announcement, Nvidia announced plans to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. within the next four years. These plants will produce Nvidia AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. Tariffs could be a headwind in the short term, but Nvidia should be able to navigate them, and there's always the possibility of a trade deal. Stock splits may get investor attention, but a company's financial results and long-term growth prospects are what really matter. Those are two areas where Nvidia shines. I wouldn't expect a repeat of its 2024 results, but I think it's one of the better and will continue to outperform the market.

TPC as the Bull of the Day and YETI Holdings, Inc. YETI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA . Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Tutor Perini Corp. just beat and raised 2025 earnings guidance as its construction backlog hit a record high. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) expects earnings in 2026 and 2027 to more than double 2025 earnings. Tutor Perini is a civil, building and specialty construction company offering general contracting and design-build services to private customers and public agencies worldwide. It has expertise on large, complex projects. Tutor Perini often self-performs multiple project components including earthwork, excavation, concrete forming and placement, steel erection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditions as well as fire protection. It's a small cap company with a market cap of $1.88 billion. On May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini reported its first quarter 2025 earnings and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 783%. It reported earnings of $0.53 compared to the Zacks Consensus of just $0.06. It was the company's second best first quarter EPS ever. Tutor Perini has beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Revenue was up 19% to $1.25 billion from $1.05 billion in the year ago period. Growth was solid across all three segments but was primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain newer, higher-margin projects. These projects have significant scope of work remaining. During the first quarter, the company voluntarily repaid the remaining $121.9 million outstanding balance of the Term Loan B, which contributed to a 24% reduction in the company's total debt as compared to the total debt at the end of 2024. Tutor Perini expects solid operating cash flow for the rest of 2025. The business keeps rolling in. In the first quarter, Tutor Perini booked another $2 billion in new awards and contract adjustments, bringing the company's new backlog to a record of $19.4 billion as of March 31, 2025. That is up 94% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2024. Included in those new awards and contracts was the $1.18 billion Manhattan Tunnel project in New York; a $100 million electrical project in Texas; $241 million in additional funding for the Apra Harbor Waterfront Repairs project in Guam; and $111 million of additional funding for certain healthcare facility projects in California. Additionally, the backlog is expected to remain robust as it has already won more than $500 million in new awards in the second quarter of 2025. But it is not resting on these laurels. Other big projects are available. In the Civil segment, Tutor Perini recently bid the multi-billion-dollar Midtown Bus Terminal Replacement project in New York and was awaiting contractor selection by the owner. Many investors are worried about the impact of the 2025 tariffs. As of May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini did not expect to see any significant impact from the tariffs or the curtailment of federal funding. But they will take that quarter by quarter. With a record backlog and opportunities to add to it further, it's not a surprise that Tutor Perini is bullish about 2025. It raised full year earnings guidance to a range of $1.60 to $1.95 from its prior guidance of $1.50 to $1.90. Tutor Perini is lightly followed on the Street, but one analyst did raise their earnings estimates for both 2025 and 2026 after the earnings report. The Zacks Consensus jumped to $1.84 from $1.53 prior to the report. That is earnings growth of 158.8% as the company lost $3.13 last year. 2026 is also looking bullish as the company said they expect earnings to more than double that of 2025 in 2026 and 2027. 1 estimate was raised for 2026 in the last 30 days as well, pushing up 2026 to $2.87. That is further earnings growth of 56%. Here's what it looks like on the 5-year price and consensus chart. Tutor Perini is a small cap company. The small caps have struggled in 2025 but not Tutor Perini. Shares soared to new 5-year highs on the earnings beat and guidance raise and are outperforming the Russell 2000 small cap index year-to-date. Yet, the company is still attractively priced. Tutor Perini trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 19.3. But it has even cheaper value metrics with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.4 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.6. A P/S ratio under 1.0 and a P/B ratio under 3.0 usually indicate value. With a record backlog, Tutor Perini is a small cap stock to keep on your short list. YETI Holdings, Inc. cut guidance in May 2025 due to the impact of the tariffs. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is now expected to see a double-digit decline in earnings this year. YETI is a designer, retailer and distributor of outdoor products worldwide. This includes coolers, drinkware, backpacks and bags. On May 8, 2025, YETI reported its first quarter 2025 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus by $0.04. Earnings were $0.31 compared to the consensus of $0.27. This was the 5 earnings beat in a row. Net sales rose 3% to $351.1 million from $341.4 million a year ago. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 4% to $196.2 million primarily due to growth in Coolers & Equipment. While Wholesale channel sales rose just 1% to $154.9 million, also due to growth in Coolers & Equipment. However, the first quarter seems like a different world as Liberation Day tariffs changed the business in April. YETI already had a plan for supply chain diversification, which is ahead of plan. It is aggressively diversifying its sourcing out of China. It expects, by the end of 2025, to have limited exposure to future goods sourced from China. Less than 5% of its total costs of goods will be related to products from China, for the U.S. market. YETI's ability to generate cash is expected to be intact, even with the disruption from the tariff impacts. But while it is mitigating the tariffs, sales and earnings are still expected to be impacted. For 2025, adjusted sales are expected to increase between 1% and 4%, down from its prior projection of 5% to 7%. Earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.02, down from the prior projection of $2.90 to $2.95. Not surprisingly, the analysts had to cut their estimates to get in line with the new guidance. 10 estimates were cut in the last 30 days for 2025. The Zacks Consensus fell to $2.04 from $2.88. That's down 25.3% from 2024, when YETI made $2.73. 10 estimates were also cut for 2026. You can see the results on the price and consensus chart. YETI was a pandemic winner as people headed outdoors. But since 2022, it's been tougher. Shares are down double digits over the last year. It's cheap. It trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. A P/E under 15 usually indicates value. YETI has a strong balance sheet. It had cash of $259 million as of the end of the first quarter and total debt of $77 million. However, it lowered its 2025 free cash flow guidance to a range of $100 to $125 million from $200 million due to the impact from supply chain disruptions as well as higher tariff cost. Investors interested in YETI might want to wait for more certainty on the tariff fall-out before jumping in. The cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday. Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year. Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. , PayPal Holdings and NVIDIA Corp. . Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain. However, it was still hovering around $110,950 and was on track to make further gains. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by a mix of positive news, including easing trade tensions, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and upbeat sentiment among institutional buyers. Bitcoin's rally followed the U.S. equity market's slump on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking a massive hit. The reason behind the diverging movement between cryptocurrencies and equities could be that investors are looking for alternative stores of value. Also, trade tensions have eased substantially over the past couple of weeks after the United States and China announced a trade truce and paused tariffs temporarily for 90 days. The United States also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom earlier this month, while the White House said trade talks with several other nations are ongoing. Besides, there have been some encouraging regulatory developments for the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act \u2014 a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins \u2014 passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate recently. Also, President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, have been rallying for a pro-crypto agenda, which has been boosting the broader crypto market. Visa Visa Inc. is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain. This expansion of V includes collaboration with prominent merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, marking a pivotal development in the world of digital payments. Visa's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 12.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 90 days. V currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . PayPal PayPal Holdings provides digital wallet services that enable users to purchase, transfer, and sell various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Through PYPL, users can use cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services from online merchants. Additionally, PayPal's mobile wallet platform, Venmo, allows users to engage in cryptocurrency buying and selling activities. PayPal's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 9.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 90 days. PYPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3. NVIDIA NVIDIA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of NVDA's stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies. NVIDIA's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 41.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 90 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

{"title": "Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?", "url": "https://finviz.com/news/65096/micron-stock-soars-23-in-a-month-time-to-hold-or-book-profits", "source": "Zacks", "scraped_at": "2025-05-26T01:30:47.207724", "published_date": "2025-05-23T08:55:00", "body": "Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period. This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock? Micron\u2019s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce. The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply. Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively. Micron\u2019s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment. Micron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth. As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron\u2019s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing. The company\u2019s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space. Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain. Additionally, Micron\u2019s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets. Micron\u2019s financial outlook remains robust. The company\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026. Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%. Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector\u2019s 6.07X. The stock\u2019s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively. While Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho. More concerning is the company\u2019s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist. Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron\u2019s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained. Micron\u2019s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term. Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now.

It makes a lot of sense, too. AI chips are the brains that power and train generative AI models, helping businesses build new products and services at warp speed -- ushering in a new wave of productivity, efficiency, and automation. For the most part, however, one name emerges more often than others in the chip realm. Obviously, I'm talking about Nvidia . I can't deny that what Nvidia has achieved over the last two years isn't impressive. Don't get me wrong -- I'm happy to be an investor in Nvidia stock. But as a long-term investor, I'm always looking for opportunities beyond the mainstream. Enter Advanced Micro Devices . With a share price decline of 31% over the last year, AMD may not look like your cup of tea. However, I'd encourage you to keep an open mind. Let's explore how AMD is making inroads in the AI chip landscape, and why now looks like a lucrative time to buy the stock hand over fist. AMD reports its financials across three business segments: Data center, client and gaming, and embedded. The data center segment competes directly with Nvidia, and recent trends in this business unit have really caught my eye. The table below breaks down AMD's data center financial profile over the last year.  Over the past year, AMD has scaled its AI business considerably. All the while, operating profit margins have been expanding -- signaling that AMD is able to fulfill demand and build its chip business in a profitable way. Data source: Investor Relations. One thing to call out is that over the last six months, it may look like AMD's chip business is beginning to show some signs slowing. I wouldn't be caught up in that idea, though. First, the semiconductor industry tends to be cyclical. Moreover, Nvidia launched its newest graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture (Blackwell) during the fourth quarter, which likely served as some form of a headwind for AMD. Nevertheless, AMD has nearly doubled its operating income in the chip business over the past year, while still accelerating sales by high double-digit percentages. Furthermore, the company is launching new architectures of its own later this year -- and that these products will be a big hit with customers. Image source: Getty Images. Perhaps the biggest reason I'm excited about AMD's future is because of the company's proven ability to win notable customers. For example, Microsoft , Oracle , and Meta Platforms are all using AMD's MI300 accelerators in addition to their respective Nvidia GPUs. On top of that, Amazon -- another Nvidia customer -- recently made a . This very well could signal partnership opportunities between AMD and Amazon's thriving cloud infrastructure business. Over the coming quarters, my outlook is that AMD's data center business will continue generating a combination of revenue growth and margin expansion, thanks to encouraging shipment trends for MI325, MI350, MI355, and MI400 series chipsets. Right now, AMD's (P/E) multiple is hovering well below its 10-year average. data by It seems to me that investors are questioning AMD's ability to capture . What I find perplexing, however, is that AMD has already proven it can do this, but for some reason the company isn't getting much credit for the growth in its data center business. In my eyes, right now, and investors should consider taking advantage of the disparity in its current valuation multiples compared to historical trends. I think the stock is cheap based on forward earnings, and long-term investors should consider holding on to a position in AMD over the next several years.

Under normal circumstances, mundane returns like these might have investors worried. But 2025 has been anything but normal. Over the last several months, financial news has been packed with storylines featuring the potential for a recession, mixed economic indicators, ongoing geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East, and (of course!) tariffs. At one point, each of the major indexes had dropped by double digit percentage points. The Nasdaq fared worst of all, declining by 21% at its low point. While the Nasdaq has bounced back considerably in recent weeks, some technology stocks are still trading for lower-than-usual valuations. Let's explore some of the biggest movers and shakers in the Nasdaq this year. From there, I'll take a look at valuation trends to help suggest if now is a good opportunity to in tech stocks. The chart below illustrates price returns for a number of different technology-themed investments, particularly in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. data by Shares of the Invesco QQQ ETF have gained roughly 2% on the year. This index fund tracks the Nasdaq-100 -- providing investors with exposure to a number of different AI stocks. Given this diversification, it's not surprising to see the Invesco QQQ outperform a number of individual volatile growth stocks this year. This leads me to the \"Magnificent Seven.\" For much of the last two years, it was pretty hard to lose money investing in Microsoft , Nvidia , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Apple , or Tesla . While timing mattered to some extent, these companies have largely become the de facto buys for AI investors. Yet this year, their respective performances have been far less predictable. Lastly, there's Palantir Technologies . Despite a brief dip back in February, to new highs -- making it one of the biggest outliers among popular AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images. An important thing to understand is that just because a stock might be outperforming its peers or the broader industry doesn't make it a smart buy. While I am bullish on Palantir, the company's valuation is stretched right now. In addition, even though shares of Tesla may appear deflated, the stock has been -- despite the company's financial picture looking pretty questionable. One pocket of the AI realm that has remained hot despite uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment is infrastructure. Companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Oracle are spending hundreds of billions of dollars building data centers and outfitting these structures with the newest chip architectures. If I were considering AI stocks right now, I'd be looking at what companies stand to capture this infrastructure spend. Some of the more obvious names that come to mind are Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , Broadcom , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing . Per the graphic above, each of these stocks is hovering around break-even levels on the year (essentially on par with the Nasdaq-100). data by If you look at the forward earnings multiples for each of these companies, there is a clear pattern of compression throughout the year. However, more recent trends illustrate some resiliency -- as the (P/E) multiples are beginning to climb ever so slightly. To me, this signals that some investors are buying the dip -- albeit cautiously. While it may take some time for these companies to begin showing accelerated growth again, secular themes fueling their respective areas of expertise in the AI market (i.e., hardware) suggest the long-run bull thesis holds up. Given how volatile the technology sector can be, it's important for investors to consider valuation before buying a growth stock. The key is to look for value and not chase momentum plays. Given the ideas explored in this piece, I do think now is a good opportunity to buy beaten-down AI stocks -- particularly in the semiconductor space.

However, the stock recouped its losses in May as hyperscale cloud companies raised their capital spending forecasts and the Trump administration revoked the Biden-era . However, there is another inflection point on the horizon. Nvidia will announce its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 after the market closes on Wednesday, May 28. The stock has often been volatile after earnings events. For instance, it declined by more than 8% following the previous report. Nevertheless, Wall Street has clear advice for investors: Among the 71 analysts who follow Nvidia, the stock has a consensus rating of \"buy\" and a median target price of $160 per share. That implies 22% upside from the current share price of $131. Here's what investors should know about Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia specializes in accelerated computing, a discipline that pairs specialized hardware and software to speed up complex data center workloads, such as . The company is best known for its , chips often referred to as AI accelerators. According to IoT Analytics, Nvidia has more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. However, the company is truly formidable because it supplements its GPUs with adjacent hardware, like CPUs, interconnects, and networking gear, such that it essentially builds entire data centers. CEO Jensen Huang says the strategy lets Nvidia build systems with the lowest total cost of ownership. Additionally, Nvidia has spent about two decades building its CUDA software platform, which now includes hundreds of code libraries, frameworks, and pretrained models that help developers build AI applications across a broad range of domains. That includes video analytics, speech recognition, recommendation engines, and customer service agents. Importantly, while generative AI capabilities have recently been the driving force behind demand for Nvidia's accelerated computing products, the company is well positioned to maintain its leadership through the next phase of the AI revolution: and . \"Physical AI and robotics will bring about the next industrial revolution,\" according to Jensen Huang. Nvidia Drive and Nvidia Isaac are platforms that support the development of self-driving cars and autonomous robots, respectively. Earlier this year, Jensen Huang said, \"We build technology that almost every self-driving car company uses.\" That list includes Alphabet 's Waymo and Tesla . Similarly, Amazon uses Nvidia Isaac to train, simulate, and manage its warehouse robots. Importantly, Nvidia debuted GR00T N1.5 earlier this month, a customizable foundation model for humanoid reasoning. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino believes GR00T will strengthen Nvidia's position in the AI ecosystem. He also believes the recent decision to open its NVLink interconnect technology -- which turns disparate chips into a single accelerator -- to custom chipmakers like Marvell and MediaTek will create new opportunities for revenue growth. Nvidia will report its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 on Wednesday, May 28. The company guided for 53% revenue growth and 49% earnings growth. But several analysts have revised their estimates lower in the last 90 days due to concerns about export restrictions and tariffs. The Wall Street consensus now says Nvidia's earnings will increase 44%. Importantly, beating that number does not necessarily guarantee a positive reaction from the market. Nvidia exceeded the top- and bottom-line estimates in the fourth quarter, but the stock fell more than 8% the next day. Investors should expect similar volatility this time around. At present, pricing data from the options market implies a 6-point swing, meaning the market expects the share price to land between $125 and $140. Investors should either listen to the conference call or read a transcript of the event. Jensen Huang will almost certainly discuss important issues like export restrictions related to the , recent deals in the , and what the company expects concerning the semiconductor tariffs that President Donald Trump has yet to finalize. So, returning to my original question: Should you buy Nvidia before May 28? Any investor who plans to hold the stock for several years can buy a small position today. If the price declines post-earnings, consider adding a few more shares. But investors looking for a quick profit should avoid the stock. There are too many unknowns to be sure of a positive reaction.

Nvidia's gaming GPU business isn't getting the attention it needs, and the end result could be significant market share losses to rival AMD . Image source: Getty Images. Putting out solid, capable hardware is only half the battle. Gaming GPUs also require software drivers that ensure good performance with minimal bugs across a wide range of old and new games. Buggy software was the main reason Intel 's largely fell flat. Nvidia now seems to be falling into the same trap.

In Rock Paper Shotgun's RTX 5060 review, the new graphics card experienced crashes, severe frame rate drops, and other performance anomalies. In some cases, using Nvidia's AI-powered DLSS frame generation feature would result in worse performance. Nvidia has been pushing that feature hard to bump up perceived frame rates in games, so the DLSS troubles are particularly embarrassing. Another problem is the meager 8 gigabytes (GB) of VRAM included. In Techspot's review, the RTX 5060 runs into problems at higher resolutions in certain games, losing badly in some cases to last-gen cards with more VRAM. In light of AMD's upcoming Radeon 9060 XT, Techspot called the RTX 5060 \"dead on arrival.\" Ouch. AMD plans to launch its Radeon 9060 XT on June 5. Two versions will be available: an 8 GB variant for $299 and a 16 GB variant for $349. While the cheaper version will run into some of the same problems as the RTX 5060, the 16 GB version could end up being a big winner among gamers on a budget who are looking to upgrade. Nvidia's driver debacle is a gift for AMD as it looks to steal away market share. Nvidia's GPU was as high as 90% in the third quarter of 2024, so the company has plenty to lose. For the vast number of PC gamers using older Nvidia GPUs, the RTX 5060 won't look enticing based on the negative reviews. If AMD's 9060 XT fares better with reviewers, customer loyalty may not be enough to keep gamers in Nvidia's camp. Given how much revenue and profit Nvidia's data center GPUs are generating, even meaningful market share losses in the gaming segment won't matter much. It would be a much bigger deal for AMD, which has been . If AMD can take advantage of Nvidia's apparent disinterest in the gaming business, the company could get a nice revenue boost this year.

But the stock hasn't recorded any gains in 2025. Investors who are avoiding the stock because they feel the big gains are in the rearview mirror might be making a mistake. Nvidia has taken a breather so far this year amid concerns that sales of its artificial intelligence (AI) advanced chips, software, and supercomputers may have peaked. Yet all the evidence is to the contrary, and the reality is Nvidia should see strong sales growth for quite a while. The stock will likely move higher before those sales are in the books, however. With a seemingly insatiable appetite for its AI products, investors who buy Nvidia stock now may be putting themselves on track to retire millionaires. Image source: Getty Images. The most obvious people to ask about demand are the ones buying the product. are still in high demand as its customers seek to expand AI compute capacity. The leaders of several big tech names reaffirmed plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year. They include Meta Platforms and Microsoft . Blackstone is an investor in , so it has a unique perspective on the industry. Chief Operating Officer Jon Gray recently said in a CNBC interview he is seeing a \"ton of demand\" related to AI data center investments. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also told CNBC recently that the availability of the advanced semiconductor chips needed for AI to expand is currently the biggest limitation. Musk also said power generation and transformer capacity will become limiting factors in the near future. That bodes well for Nvidia's cadence of delivering more efficient chips on an annual basis. Nvidia isn't just relying on keeping its lead in supplying GPU chips, either. That's the critical factor for those -- a long runway of growth is key. In addition to updating its GPU technology offering annually, Nvidia just made an important announcement that can expand its market opportunities. CEO Jensen Huang unveiled a new strategy using Nvidia's NVLink interconnect technology. NVLink is Nvidia's proprietary interconnect technology for chips that enables high-bandwidth connections between Nvidia GPUs, , and custom silicon. It introduced NVLink Fusion, which allows third-party CPUs and accelerators to pair with Nvidia GPUs in circuit boards and server racks. NVLink Fusion will help cement Nvidia's AI ecosystem dominance by allowing a more open model to expand the creation of AI architecture Nvidia currently controls. It helps ensure that the core of the system continues to run through Nvidia's GPU platform. The open-system strategy lets Nvidia maintain control of data center infrastructure while letting competitors innovate around it. Plus, customers that are developing their own in-house strategies to save costs could instead choose to supply chips while still interconnecting with Nvidia infrastructure. First Nvidia beat the competition, now it's inviting them to work with it. That's the right long-term strategy for investors who are also . It could accelerate the use of Nvidia platforms by more industries that might prefer a \"plug-and-play\" type option. If it wasn't already, Nvidia has secured its position as the standard for scaling AI systems. Investors could do well to own shares now as its growing ecosystem will result in growing sales and profits for years to come. It might just be the best stock market option for those looking to retire as millionaires.

The GPU will be part of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s Blackwell-architecture AI processors. It is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, significantly lower than the recently restricted H20 model. The lower price reflects the GPU\u2019s weaker specifications, which sources say will be based on RTX Pro 6000D and use GDDR7 memory in place of more advanced memory. They also added that it will not use TSMC\u2019s advanced CoWoS packaging technology. China is an attractive market for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The country accounted for nearly 13% of its sales last year. This is the third instance of the company having to tailor a GPU for the Chinese market due to restrictions from American authorities. After the U.S. banned the H20 chip in April this year, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) considered manufacturing a downgraded version of the chip for China, but the plan did not work out. Sources also told Reuters that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was planning to build another Blackwell AI chip for China, with production expected to begin in September. The company\u2019s market share in China has declined since 2022 due to the U.S. export restrictions, resulting in an increasing number of Chinese customers turning toward Huawei's chips.

Is it time to buy these two beaten-down tech stocks? Image source: Getty Images. has fallen 47% from its previous peak, but the shares got a boost after the company's first-quarter earnings report in May. Despite tariffs creating a lot of uncertainty for businesses, AMD surprised investors by reporting its fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, led by demand for its and AI chips. While revenue and earnings fell sequentially over the fourth quarter, demand remains significantly elevated over last year. For Q1, revenue surged 36% year over year to $7.4 billion, with adjusted earnings up 55%. One factor sending the stock higher after the report was AMD's positive outlook for its embedded chip business, which includes sales to industrial markets. This segment posted revenue declines over the past year, but management is now guiding for a return to growth in the second half of 2025. Additionally, strong demand for AMD's new Radeon 9070 series graphics chips drove a revenue increase in the gaming segment of 28% year over year in the quarter. If both the embedded and gaming segments are growing later this year, AMD stock could potentially climb higher. The stock is trading at a of 29, which looks attractive for a company with a history of delivering strong growth. But one factor weighing on the stock price is chip export restrictions to China, which AMD expects to reduce its full-year revenue by $1.5 billion. However, management sees the stock as undervalued based on its long-term prospects. It recently announced a $6 billion , bringing its total share repurchase authorization to $10 billion. CEO Lisa Su said: \"Our expanded share repurchase program reflects the Board's confidence in AMD's strategic direction, growth prospects, and ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow.\" With AMD on the verge of potentially seeing all its segments return to growth, in addition to pursuing a $500 billion AI chip opportunity, the stock appears to be a compelling buy. The soaring demand for AI chips is also creating a strong demand environment for storage and memory products to transmit massive amounts of data in data centers. is a leading manufacturer of these products, but uncertainty over near-term demand trends has sent the stock 37% off its recent highs. Micron Technology operates in a highly cyclical industry. It sells memory and solid-state storage products into consumer and data center markets. The company's revenue has trended higher over the last 15 years, and it is currently sitting close to record highs from booming data center demand over the past year. Micron is currently in a strong demand cycle. The company's revenue grew 38% year over year in the most recent quarter,  and management expects record quarterly revenue in the fiscal third quarter, driven by the data center market. Investors should be aware that Micron carries a higher risk than AMD. While AMD's annual revenue growth has been more consistent year to year, Micron's annual revenue in the last five years looks like a roller coaster. Investors need to know if the demand from data centers can support higher revenue and earnings in the coming years. One reason to like Micron's prospects is that data centers are going to need more memory and storage for data processing. It's absolutely essential, which is why Micron is experiencing such strong demand for high-bandwidth memory products right now. But this is a competitive market, with several manufacturers vying for market share. This can create volatile swings in selling prices that affect Micron's revenue, hence why its revenue has been volatile in recent years. Despite fluctuation in year-to-year financials due to these risk factors, Micron's innovation in memory technology, where new products are constantly pushing the needle on data retrieval speeds and overall performance, is driving higher demand over the long term. Micron is well-positioned to be a leader in serving booming markets like AI and cloud computing for years to come, and that should lead to higher revenue over the next 10 years, even though this growth may not happen in a smooth line.

Weyerhaeuser is one of the world\u2019s largest owners of timberland, controlling millions of acres of forest used to grow and harvest timber. The company is also one of the largest producers of wood products in North America. Weyerhaeuser recently announced a share buyback program worth $1 billion . The company has spent almost $100 million in buybacks so far in 2025, which completed its previous $1 billion buyback program. For Weyerhaeuser, $1 billion represents around 5% of the company\u2019s market capitalization . The company also has a very solid indicated dividend yield of around 3.2% . For Weyerhaeuser, the other important news was an update on its partnership with one of Warren Buffett's biggest recent bets . Weyerhaeuser has a partnership with Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) to capture and sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. Weyerhaeuser has agreed to lease 30,000 acres of underground space below its forest to store CO2. Occidental recently announced a 25-year agreement with CF Industries and other partners to store 2.3 million tons a year of CO2 under Weyerhaeuser\u2019s forest. The facility that CF Industries is building won\u2019t be operational until 2029. However, once it is, Weyerhaeuser will have a long-term source of revenue that will cost the company relatively little. Weyerhaeuser will still continue to grow and harvest timber above the land.

This is equal to over 5% of the stock\u2019s market capitalization as of the May 16 close. The other huge piece of news was the deal AMD struck with Saudi Arabia . AMD announced a $10 billion deal with HUMAIN , a new AI company operated by the Saudi government, to supply AI computing technology . This comes as the Trump administration ended the AI Diffusion rule , clearing the path for U.S. chip companies to work with the country. This likely won\u2019t be the last agreement struck by AMD and countries that have had their AI ambitions limited by the AI Diffusion rule. Last up is .

For the last two years, investors have been consistently reminded of just how dominant Nvidia's presence is in the world of high-performance chipsets, known as graphics processing units (GPUs). While Advanced Micro Devices has started to build respectable momentum in the GPU world, the company largely remains in Nvidia's shadow. Unsurprisingly, AMD stock hasn't experienced anywhere near the same level of enthusiasm compared to Nvidia during the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. That might change sooner rather than later, however. Let's explore an important announcement investors may have missed from AMD, and assess why now could be a great opportunity to buy the stock. On May 14, AMD announced that its board of directors approved a $6 billion . This is in addition to AMD's existing $4 billion buyback authorization, bringing the total amount to $10 billion. Data by . Over the last year, AMD stock has fallen roughly 30%, and in that time, you can see the company has been ramping up its buyback activity. I'll explain why these dynamics are important. AMD's financial profile can be hard to decipher at first glance. During the first quarter, AMD generated $7.4 billion in revenue -- up 36% year over year. While that looks solid, there's more than meets the eye here. AMD has been experiencing deceleration across its gaming and embedded segments for quite a while now, and Q1 was no exception. Nevertheless, growth from the company's data center and client segments contributed enough to make up for the other business units. The data center business currently makes up about half of AMD's total revenue while boasting a higher operating margin than the client and gaming segment. While these trends are encouraging, AMD's share price action suggests that investors are either uninspired or have their doubts over AMD's ability to compete with Nvidia. While when it comes to data center GPUs, AMD's pace of innovation should not be glossed over. Over the last year, AMD has managed to attract a number of existing Nvidia customers such as Oracle , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms -- each of whom have become adopters of AMD's MI300 accelerators. I think AMD's ongoing buybacks and the new $6 billion repurchase program signal that management sees investors aren't giving the company much credit for its . At the same time, this segment of AMD's business is still in its early stages and has yet to scale. For this reason, management sees AMD shares as undervalued -- hence, the company has been buying back stock. Image source: Getty Images. While AMD's (P/E) multiple may not appear cheap, the downward trend signals clear valuation compression that's hard to overlook. Data by . The timing of the new repurchase authorization is key. AMD is scheduled to launch a line of new GPU architectures later this year. The company's decision to increase its buybacks now could also signal that management is confident in the long-run , making the stock a good value at current levels. As successor chip architectures continue to be released and AMD attracts more customers, the data center business should extend its lead as the biggest contributor of sales and profits for the company. AMD stock is down nearly 50% from its all-time high, and investors with a long-run time horizon should scoop up shares, while they still trade at this reasonable price point. Management appears to have high conviction in the company's growth prospects.

These filings are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and essentially serve as an itemized breakdown of what stocks large money managers bought and sold during the most recent quarter. Beyond traditional financial institutions such as hedge funds and banks, corporations are also required to file a 13F if they also own positions in other public companies. Let's explore what investments Amazon made during the first quarter, and assess what it could mean for Nvidia in the long run. According to its most recent 13F, Amazon holds stock in nine public companies. Among its long-term positions are electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive as well as semiconductor stock Marvell Technology . During the first quarter, Amazon complemented its exposure to chip stocks by initiating a position in Advanced Micro Devices . Per the filing, Amazon purchased 822,234 shares of AMD -- worth about $84 million at its current price. Over the last couple of years ago, Amazon has invested $8 billion into an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up called . Per the terms of their partnership, Anthropic uses Amazon's cloud infrastructure, Amazon Web Services ( ), to train its generative AI models. Furthermore, Anthropic also leverages Amazon's -- dubbed Trainium and Inferentia. Since Anthropic has become a new pillar supporting AWS, the cloud infrastructure business has . This is important, as these dynamics underscore that Amazon is already generating strong unit economics on its AI-related investments. This provides Amazon with a high degree of financial flexibility, which it can use to make further investments in other pockets of the AI realm. This is why I think the investment in AMD is so notable. Amazon already uses a combination of its in-house chips with Nvidia's GPU architecture. Image source: Getty Images. However, by investing in AMD, Amazon may be looking to complement its current chip stack -- ultimately making moves to further migrate away from Nvidia. Given Amazon is doubling down on AI infrastructure projects, including , I'm optimistic that AMD has a lucrative opportunity to emerge as a key partner to the cloud hyperscaler and begin to encroach on Nvidia's market share. As of this writing, AMD's (P/E) multiple is 29. For context, the average forward P/E across the S&P 500 index is about 20. The disparity between AMD's forward P/E compared to that of the S&P 500 might suggest that the semiconductor stock is a bit pricey. I don't necessarily see it that way, however. Per the graph below, investors can see that AMD's forward P/E has been on the decline for a year now. To me, this suggests that investors may have some questions over the company's growth prospects. Taking this a step further, my suspicion is that investors are doubtful that AMD's growth will ever match that of Nvidia. data by To me, that isn't the best approach when evaluating an investment in AMD. Instead, I'd encourage investors to consider just how quickly the company has over the last year while winning over the likes of Meta Platforms , Microsoft , and Oracle as key customers. Just like Amazon, all of those companies also rely heavily on Nvidia chips -- and yet have recently been turning to AMD as an alternative provider. When you take these details into account, combined with the fact that AMD is launching new GPU architectures later this year, it could be argued that the stock is actually trading for a reasonable price considering investor expectations seem to be somewhat conservative. I think Amazon's decision to make an investment in AMD adds validity to the chipmaker's reputation, and I wouldn't be surprised if the company becomes an integral part of Amazon's AI infrastructure roadmap. I see AMD stock as a no-brainer buying opportunity right now. Investors may want to consider a position in AMD, because its prospects could be more robust in the long run compared to Nvidia, as Nvidia continues to push against headwinds such as custom silicon designs and new architectures from AMD.

Gross margin improved to 54%, driven by higher Data Center and Ryzen processor sales. The Data Center segment was the primary growth driver, with revenue rising 57% to $3.7 billion, fueled by strong demand for Instinct AI accelerators and the ramp-up of 5th Gen EPYC Turin processors. AI workloads are a major growth driver for AMD, and we explored something similar in the case. Despite a slight sequential dip due to prior-year demand spikes, management expects growth to resume in H2 with new MI350 accelerators. EPYC processors saw continued market share gains across cloud and enterprise, with major hyperscalers expanding deployments. AMD also completed the acquisition of ZT Systems to bolster AI rack-level solution offerings. The Client segment grew 68% to $2.3 billion, benefiting from Ryzen CPU strength and rising commercial PC sales. Conversely, Gaming revenue declined 30% due to lower semi-custom SoC sales, though new Radeon GPUs saw strong demand.The Embedded segment showed gradual recovery but declined 3% YoY. Looking ahead, AMD expects Q2 revenue around $7.4 billion, impacted by export restrictions on MI308 GPU shipments to China.

The chipmaker has been showing signs of progress and a faster growth rate. That could be indicative of the competition that its chips may offer to rival Nvidia , potentially giving the tech giant something to worry about. AMD's stock has been struggling over the past couple of years, while Nvidia has been soaring. But with stronger results and some encouraging growth prospects, is it now time for AMD's stock to shine? Could the company's recent earnings numbers be a catalyst to drive its valuation far higher this year? Image source: Getty Images. AMD's first-quarter report delivered something have been craving for a while now -- strong growth numbers. Revenue rose by 36% year over year to $7.4 billion. That was the company's fastest rate of growth in more than two years, and the top line came in better than the $7.1 billion that Wall Street was expecting. data by The big catalyst for the business was its data center segment, which experienced a 57% growth rate during the period. This was due in part to strong demand for its Instinct chip; the company launched its newest version, the Instinct MI325X, in the fall of last year and said at the time that it would be shipping it in large quantities in the early part of 2025. The Q1 results could be the first sign that the chips are winning over customers and may be able to take some market share from Nvidia. Shares of AMD rallied in the days following the earnings release. However, it may not necessarily be smooth sailing for the chipmaker due to a couple of issues. The first pertains to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. Due to U.S. export restrictions on China, AMD expects to miss out on $1.5 billion in potential revenue this year. Recently, however, there have been reports that the two nations are making progress on a potential trade deal and have paused most of the heavy tariffs they have levied on each other for 90 days. The uncertainty makes it difficult to predict how AMD will do this year. It's an evolving situation that investors should closely monitor. Another issue is that AMD's valuation remains high at 75 times its trailing earnings. The good news is that the ratio drops to 25 when looking at its future earnings (based on analysts' consensus expectations). But when you consider that Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings multiple is just under 27, that may not be enough of a discount to convince investors to go with AMD instead of its bigger rival. AMD's stock is down by close to 30% from where it traded a year ago, but it has been rising recently and could head higher, especially if the company can build on its Q1 results and accelerate its growth rate. But that's not a guarantee by any means, given the uncertainty around tariffs and the ongoing trade war with China. AMD could be a good to own, but it's a riskier option than Nvidia, which has stronger margins and a dominant position in the AI chip market. Depending on your risk tolerance, you may want to go with AMD, Nvidia, or perhaps even hold both in your portfolio.

Less than a month ago, the S&P 500 was down as much as 15% on the year while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fared even worse -- dropping by as much as 21%. Over the last several weeks, however, the capital markets have shown some signs of resiliency and gradually started to rebound. As of this writing, the S&P 500 is now near breakeven on the year while the Nasdaq is down by just 3%. One of the contributing factors to these recent jolts has been quarterly earnings. Throughout April, companies have reported financial results for the first quarter of 2025. And for the most part, investors appear to be pleased with where things stand. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) companies not only reported strong financials in Q1, but their outlooks remained quite robust. Cloud hyperscalers Amazon , Microsoft , and Alphabet maintained their capital expenditure (capex) guidance for the year, while Meta Platforms actually raised its AI infrastructure outlook. Indeed, these are positive tailwinds for GPU players such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . While Nvidia is scheduled to , I actually have my eyes on another semiconductor stock that could be the better buy this month. Let's explore why Broadcom looks like a great under-the-radar opportunity right now. Among cloud hyperscalers and Meta, AI infrastructure spend is forecast to be above $300 billion just this year. While much of that spend will be allocated toward GPUs developed by Nvidia and AMD, each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" players I referenced above are also building their own in-house chips. is a unique solution that Broadcom offers, hence rising AI capex from these players is also a positive sign for the company. In fact, during the earnings call back in March, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that the company beat its AI revenue target \"due to stronger shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers.\" As Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet continue to outfit with AI GPUs and networking equipment, it's highly likely that Broadcom is going to touch this infrastructure in some capacity. Image source: Getty Images. The chart below illustrates Broadcom's share price movement since the company reported its last earnings on March 6. While you might think these returns are due to a positively received earnings report, I think something else is at play here. data by You'll notice that the entirety of the gains illustrated above occurred after March. What may have been the catalyst here? Well, on April 7 Broadcom announced a $10 billion authorization. The . This does not mean that Broadcom has to buy all (or any) stock back; but if it chooses to do so, it only has until the end of the year. Given that Broadcom made this announcement alongside a wave of encouraging earnings reports and renewed AI infrastructure investments, I think it's likely that management sees a rebound in store for the stock during the latter half of the year on the back of continued strength in the AI business and demand from hyperscalers. Hence, the timing of the buyback seems strategic in my eyes. Broadcom is scheduled to report earnings on June 5. At that point in time, each of the Magnificent Seven companies and AMD will have reported. The common thread among them is that growth is humming along just fine across their respective AI businesses. I'm optimistic the same will be in store for Broadcom. Should Nvidia's earnings report later this month follow in the footsteps of its peers, I think it's likely that Broadcom shares could get dragged into a macro uptick. Moreover, during the earnings report investors should also get an idea whether or not part of the stock's recent surge could be attributed to the buyback. For these reasons, I think now is a great -- before the company reports earnings in early June.

The closed just under $5,900 on May 14, just around 4% lower than the all-time high it reached in February. As market sentiment shifts, , a leading , has emerged as a top beneficiary. Despite at one point being down nearly 38% in 2025, Broadcom is now just slightly in the green this year as of the May 14 close. The announcement of the trade deal between the U.S. and China boosted the stock. Shares jumped almost 12% within two days after the announcement. However, there were other highly positive recent pieces of news for Broadcom that the trade deal may somewhat overshadow. Most notable is that Its end has the potential to substantially benefit companies like Broadcom . So, what exactly was the AI Diffusion Rule , and what does its cancellation mean for Broadcom? The purpose of the AI Diffusion Rule was to give the U.S. government extensive control over which countries can and cannot get access to advanced AI chips made by American firms . Specifically, it controls chips used to train advanced AI models. The rule . Tier 1 countries included many of America\u2019s closest allies. These countries face no restrictions. Tier 2 countries include most other countries. India, Israel, Singapore, Switzerland, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were notable inclusions. These countries were limited in the number of chips they could buy. Tier 3 countries , which include adversaries like China and Russia, were not allowed to buy any advanced chips. Really, the government was trying to specifically prevent China and Russia from getting these chips to slow the advancement of their AI capabilities. With the ending of AI Diffusion , that isn\u2019t likely to change. However, how the United States treats those Tier 2 countries is changing. announcement that on the same day the government eliminated the AI Diffusion rule provides evidence of this. also . Overall, the end of AI Diffusion means that chip companies with significant AI capabilities now have a much larger opportunity to sell their most advanced technology to these Tier 2 countries. Many of these countries are extremely wealthy, adding to the size of the opportunity . This extends to Broadcom, but in a slightly different way than NVIDIA and AMD. Broadcom's custom chips are largely , rather than primarily for AI model training. Training comes before inference. For countries like Saudi Arabia, this means they need time to train their models with NVIDIA and AMD chips . After that, Broadcom's chips can really make a difference. Thus, the fact that NVIDIA and AMD are striking deals opens up the door for Broadcom to sell large amounts of chips to Tier 2 countries down the line. How long that might take is hard to say, but a big opportunity now exists for Broadcom nonetheless. The benefit to Broadcom comes even though the company hasn\u2019t expressed concerns about AI Diffusion, at least with a specific set of customers. In the company\u2019s last earnings call , Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon specifically asked about this. Rasgon asked whether AI diffusion would impact Broadcom\u2019s design wins or shipments for the three big AI customers the firm is selling to in volume. In response, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hock Tan said, \u201c .\" This underscores Broadcom\u2019s focus on inference chips , which AI Diffusion did not directly impact. However, they were indirectly impacted because training comes before inference. So, with AI Diffusion ending, the positive impact on Broadcom comes from the expansion of its serviceable market. For the reasons discussed above, Broadcom can win big due to AI Diffusion ending . Its chips now have a strong path forward to getting into the hands of some of these huge Tier 2 countries.

The company has unveiled a multimodal voice and screen-driven assistant that helps physicians reduce documentation time by approximately 30%, addressing the critical issue of clinician burnout in healthcare settings. Oracle Health Clinical AI Agent combines generative AI, agentic technology, automation, and simplified workflows into a unified solution that integrates directly with Oracle's electronic health record systems. Already deployed across 40 medical specialties, the solution has facilitated the creation of nearly a million notes while enabling healthcare providers to access critical patient information through natural voice commands. The healthcare AI announcement aligns with statements made by Oracle CTO Larry Ellison during the recent third-quarter earnings call, where he highlighted the company's AI agent development. \"We have built lots of AI agents on top of Oracle databases and made those agents a part of our applications, modernizing and automating our applications,\" Ellison noted, specifically mentioning healthcare as a sector where Oracle's AI agents provide significant differentiation. Oracle's third-quarter fiscal 2025 results showed both strengths and challenges. The company reported total revenues of $14.1 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year increase in USD and 8% in constant currency. Cloud services and license support revenues grew to $11 billion, up 12% in constant currency, while cloud infrastructure revenues increased 51%. Particularly impressive was Oracle's remaining performance obligations, which surged 63% year over year to $130 billion. CEO Safra Catz emphasized this metric as a leading indicator of future revenue growth, projecting a 15% increase in overall revenues for fiscal 2026 and approximately 20% for fiscal 2027. However, Oracle reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.47 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 0.68%. Revenues of $14.13 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.59%, disappointing investors\u2019 enthusiasm for the company\u2019s ascendant cloud business. The company's cloud license and on-premise license revenues declined 10% year over year (down 8% at cc) to $1.12 billion. Oracle trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 21.06x, substantially above the Zacks Computer-Software industry average of 16.6x. This premium valuation suggests that investors have already priced in exceptional future growth \u2014 growth that Oracle is increasingly struggling to deliver with modest revenue increases of just 6% year over year (8% in constant currency). The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.03 per share, down 0.2% over the past 30 days. Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has become a standout performer, with OCI consumption revenues increasing 57%. The company reached a milestone with its 101st cloud region coming online, positioning it to potentially surpass all competitors' combined cloud regions in the near future. The company has attracted major technology players like Advanced Micro Devices AMD, CrowdStrike CRWD and Palo Alto Networks PANW to its cloud platform, while also making significant inroads with hyperscalers through its Database@Cloud service offering, which grew 200% in the last quarter. However, during its latest earnings call, Oracle acknowledged that component delays have hampered cloud capacity expansion \u2014 a significant admission for a company positioning itself as a critical infrastructure provider for AI workloads. At a time when competitors like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google Cloud are rapidly scaling their infrastructure to meet surging AI demand, Oracle's supply chain challenges represent a competitive disadvantage that could cost it critical market share. With a 2.2% decline in the year-to-date period, ORCL has underperformed both the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500, which dropped 1.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Despite Oracle's impressive cloud growth and AI strategy, investors may want to exercise caution in the near term. The company currently trades at elevated valuation multiples relative to historical norms, while facing potential headwinds from component supply chain issues that have temporarily constrained cloud capacity expansion. While the backlog of $130 billion provides strong visibility into future growth, the company indicated that component delays have slowed cloud capacity expansion, potentially limiting near-term revenue conversion. Safra Catz noted that these constraints should ease in first-quarter fiscal 2026, which suggests that better growth acceleration may materialize later in 2025. Oracle's heavy capital expenditures, expected to exceed $16 billion for fiscal 2025, will pressure free cash flow in the immediate future. The trailing 12-month free cash flow of $5.8 billion represents a 53% year-over-year decline, primarily due to strategic infrastructure investments. Given these mixed signals, investors may find better entry points later in 2025 as cloud capacity constraints ease and the significant investments in AI infrastructure begin to generate stronger returns. The long-term thesis remains compelling, but patience could yield more attractive valuation opportunities for this cloud and AI transformation story. Oracle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

AMD is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corporation NVDA by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Humain, the query arises on AMD\u2019s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let\u2019s analyze. Several semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals. AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn\u2019t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million. NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration\u2019s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China. Thus, it\u2019s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corporation BAC analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD\u2019s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years. Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA\u2019s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can\u2019t afford NVIDIA\u2019s pricey products. Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That\u2019s why Microsoft Corporation MSFT is using AMD\u2019s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corporation ORCL has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chips. While these factors may increase AMD\u2019s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA\u2019s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA\u2019s quarterly performance, driving up its share price. This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA\u2019s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93. Whereas, brokers have increased AMD\u2019s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?). While AMD may not surpass NVIDIA\u2019s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management\u2019s optimism about the company\u2019s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock. However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Let's look at three top tech stocks to buy this month. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to , Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies. The company's have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, providing the processing power necessary to run AI workloads. The company is the dominant player in the GPU space, with a market share exceeding 80%. This dominance stems from its CUDA software platform, which allows developers to easily program its chips, as well as its collection of AI-specific libraries and tools that improve its chips' performance running AI workloads. AI-related data center spending continues to surge. The three major cloud providers -- Amazon , Microsoft , and Google -- are expected to spend a combined $250 billion this year to expand capacity and meet growing demand from customers running AI workloads. At the same time, tech giants like Meta Platforms and OpenAI are racing to build more powerful AI models, which require increasingly more computing power. Enterprises are also ramping up their infrastructure investments, adopting hybrid cloud strategies to support internal AI deployment. For its part, Nvidia expects these tailwinds to continue, predicting that data center will surpass $1 trillion in 2028. If it does, the company will be a prime beneficiary given its position in the market. At the same time, the stock remains attractively priced, trading at a of 28 times this year's analyst estimates and a 0.56 ) ratio, with numbers below 1 considered undervalued. While a distant second in the GPU market to Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices is still seeing strong data center growth. The company has been making some inroads in the GPU space, particularly in the market. While training has been the early focus of AI infrastructure investment, inference is eventually expected to become a much larger market. That is good news for AMD. In fact, on its last earnings call, the company said that one of the largest AI model companies is now using its GPUs to process a meaningful percentage of its daily inference traffic. AMD added that several major cloud providers are using more of its GPUs to handle generative AI tasks like search, rankings, and recommendations. The company has also become the leader in providing for data centers, where it has been gaining market share. While GPUs provide the processing power, CPUs are the brains behind the operation. It's not nearly as big as the GPU market, but it is an important and strongly growing market. Between its leadership in the data center CPU space and the opportunity it will have with AI inference, AMD is another solid AI infrastructure play. With a forward P/E of 27.5 times, the stock holds a lot of upside potential at a reasonable price. Another company set to benefit nicely from the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , or TSMC for short. The company is the leading semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world, and, as such, is benefiting from the increased demand for GPUs and other advanced chips. Today, most leading semiconductor companies focus on designing chips while outsourcing their manufacturing to foundries like TSMC. The reason is quite simple: Chip fabrication is extremely capital-intensive, requiring billions of dollars to build and operate a chip manufacturing facility. To be profitable, these facilities must also run at or near full capacity. On top of that, manufacturing cutting-edge chips requires strong technical expertise and constant investment. Foundries are continually pushing the limits to shrink chip sizes to deliver more powerful and energy-efficient chips. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have helped separate the company from its competitors and allowed it to become a valuable partner to leading chip designers such as Nvidia. It has also given the company solid pricing power, which led to steady gross margin improvement. Currently, the company is working closely with its largest customers to build manufacturing capacity to help them meet future needs, while broadening its geographic footprint. This includes a big investment in new facilities in the U.S. The stock is also attractively valued with a forward P/E of 20.5 and a PEG of 0.62.

{"title": "Should You Buy Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Stock After Its 47% Drop?", "url": "https://finviz.com/news/59157/should-you-buy-advanced-micro-devices-amd-stock-after-its-47-drop", "source": "Motley Fool", "scraped_at": "2025-05-26T01:39:28.548906", "published_date": "2025-05-16T04:24:00", "body": "Advanced Micro Devices supplies some of the best chips in the world for computers, cars, game consoles, and data centers. The company's data center business is a key focus for investors right now, as demand soars for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are designed for artificial intelligence (AI) development. AMD, as its known, is still chasing Nvidia in the AI data center market, but the company's latest GPUs could help close the gap. Plus, AMD is already a leading supplier of AI chips for personal computers, which could be the next big growth segment. The stock is down 47% from its record high last year, primarily due to sluggish results from its gaming business. But AI could be the biggest opportunity in the company's history, so should investors swoop in and buy the dip? Image source: Getty Images. AMD's MI300X data center is the company's top chip, and it won over many of Nvidia's top customers, including Microsoft , Meta Platforms , and Oracle . But the company is now gearing up to start shipping its MI350 series, which is based on a new architecture called CDNA (Compute DNA) 4. CDNA 4 GPUs like the upcoming MI355X can deliver up to 35 times more performance than the MI300X, so they are a legitimate competitive threat to , which recently started shipping at scale. MI355X production will ramp up into the middle of this year, and a whopping 30,000 of them in a multi-billion-dollar deal. But AMD isn't standing still. It's already working on its new MI400 series which will launch in 2026. These chips will likely deliver a similar level of performance to Nvidia's recently announced Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Simply put, AMD is closing the performance gap with Nvidia with every new generation of its GPUs. Longer term, AMD is preparing for AI workloads to shift from data centers to personal computers (PCs), which means people will be able to use powerful AI software without an internet connection, creating a faster and more convenient experience. The company launched a series of accelerated processing units (APUs) under its Ryzen AI banner, which feature a GPU, a central processing unit ( ), and a neural processing unit (NPU) packaged into one chip. Millions of computers have already shipped with AMD's Ryzen AI chips since 2023, from top manufacturers like Microsoft, HP , and Dell . However, the company just launched its most powerful variant so far, Ryzen AI Max, which set the benchmark for AI processing and battery life. As more AI workloads shift onto PCs and devices, this part of AMD's business could become even more important than the data center. AMD generated $7.4 billion in total during the first quarter of 2025. It represented a 36% increase from the year-ago period, and it was comfortably above Wall Street's forecast of $7.1 billion. But the real stories are beneath the surface of the headline number. The chipmaker generated $3.7 billion in data center revenue during Q1, which was up 57% year over year thanks partly to strong AI GPU sales. Plus, the company's client segment -- which is where it accounts for Ryzen AI PC chip sales -- saw revenue soar by 68% to $2.3 billion. That means the two segments of AMD's business that rely the most on sales now account for over 81% of the company's total revenue, which bodes well for its future growth prospects. But here's the bad news: AMD's other two segments continue to struggle. Its gaming business generated $647 million in revenue, which was down 30% year over year, but it did grow sequentially (compared to the fourth quarter of 2024) thanks to the launch of the new Radeon 9070 GPU. Demand is outstripping supply for the new chip, but AMD is working to replenish inventory, so there could be further sequential growth from the gaming segment during the current second quarter of 2025. AMD's embedded business delivered $823 million in sales, which represented a decline of 3% from a year ago. But the company expects improving demand from key markets like aerospace, which could fuel a return to growth in the second half of 2025. Image source: Advanced Micro Devices. AMD has generated $3.66 in (generally accepted accounting principles) (EPS) over the last four quarters, placing its stock at a of 29.5. That's a 28% discount to Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 41.1. So AMD looks like a good value compared to its biggest competitor. Moreover, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests that AMD's EPS could soar to $5.74 in 2026, which places its stock at a of 18.8. That means the stock would have to soar by 57% by the end of next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 29.5, and by a whopping 118% if it were to match Nvidia's current P/E of 41.1. Microsoft, , Amazon , and Alphabet plan to (combined) this year on AI data center infrastructure and chips, based on their latest forecasts. That doesn't include spending from other AI giants like Oracle, OpenAI, or Tesla . But this is just the beginning. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks annual AI data center spending will continue to grow, eventually hitting $1 trillion per year by 2028. AMD could find itself with a growing piece of that enormous pie as its MI350 shipments ramp up later this year, and then again when its MI400 chips hit the market. Therefore, the 47% drop in its stock has created a great opportunity for investors to buy into this exciting growth story at an attractive valuation.

ServiceNow, which went public in 2012, has soared nearly 5,680% from its initial public offering (IPO) price. AMD went public back in 1979, but its stock has surged about 4,900% in the past 20 years alone. CrowdStrike's stock has rallied roughly 1,190% since its IPO in 2019. Investors might be reluctant to buy those growth stocks today as the Trump administration's unpredictable tariffs and other macro headwinds rattle the markets. However, I believe these three stocks could still have plenty of room to run over the next decade. Image source: Getty Images. ServiceNow's platform helps large companies organize their businesses by streamlining their work patterns into structured digital workflows. By breaking down the silos and getting everyone on the same page, ServiceNow makes it easier to delegate tasks, support hybrid and remote workers, execute faster decisions, and trim expenses. Its Now Assist accelerates that process with even more automation tools and chatbots. ServiceNow's business thrives in both bull and bear markets. Companies will use its platform to expand efficiently when the economy is healthy, and they'll use it to trim fat during economic downturns. From 2019 to 2024, its number of year-end customers with an annual contract value of more than $1 million more than doubled from 892 to 2,109. It achieved that growth even as its clients navigated the pandemic, inflation, rising rates, and other macro headwinds. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect ServiceNow's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 27%. The company might not seem like a bargain at 120 times this year's earnings, but it should keep growing at double-digits over the next decade as it continues to modernize workflows with its cloud and AI services. AMD is the world's second largest producer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers after Intel . It's also the second largest producer of discrete GPUs as Nvidia . AMD is the underdog in both markets, but it's still grown like a weed ever since Lisa Su took the helm as its CEO in 2014. Under Su, AMD diligently redesigned its CPUs and GPUs, outsourced most of its production to TSMC , and sold more custom APUs (accelerated processing units) for gaming consoles. AMD also acquired Xilinx to expand its programmable chip business, ZT Systems for its data center infrastructure, and other smaller companies to diversify its business beyond the cyclical PC market. AMD's manufacturing partnership with TSMC enabled AMD to pull , which struggled to manufacture smaller chips at its own foundries, over the past several years. Moreover, AMD rolled out cheaper data center GPUs to challenge Nvidia in the AI market. Those long-term catalysts should fuel its growth for at least the next 10 years. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect AMD's revenue and EPS to increase at a CAGR of 18% and 66%, respectively. It isn't cheap at 59 times this year's earnings, but it could remain one of the easiest ways to profit from the secular growth of the semiconductor sector. CrowdStrike's main platform, Falcon, provides endpoint security services to a wide range of industries. But unlike many older cybersecurity companies, which install their services through on-site appliances, CrowdStrike only provides its tools as cloud-based services -- which are stickier, easier to scale as a company expands, and can be updated remotely. From fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2025 (which ended in January), CrowdStrike's percentage of year-end customers which had adopted at least five of its cloud-based modules rose from 33% to 67%. As it locks its customers in more tightly with those modules, CrowdStrike is rolling out new agentic AI-driven services to keep pace with AI-powered challengers like SentinelOne . From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 23%. They also expect the company to turn profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles ( ) basis in fiscal 2027 and more than triple its net income the following year. CrowdStrike's stock might seem pricey at 23 times this year's sales, but it should flourish over the next decade for three simple reasons: its cloud-native approach to cybersecurity is disruptive, the cybersecurity market is still growing, and it's resistant to recessions because companies won't shut off their digital defenses to save a few dollars. Therefore, investing in CrowdStrike could be a smart move for patient long-term investors.

While Wall Street has been mostly focusing on Nvidia , AMD has quietly established itself as a strong player in the AI data center business. The company provides high-performance computing hardware and software solutions to clients for processing cloud and AI workloads. In the first quarter of 2025, data center revenue grew 57% year over year to $3.67 billion, making up almost half of AMD's total revenue. Data center AI business revenue also increased by a double-digit percentage year over year, driven by increased shipments of the MI325X accelerators for new cloud and enterprise workloads. Image source: Getty Images. With AI inferencing costs escalating rapidly, AMD is in a better position to capture a bigger share of the AI market. Its Instinct GPUs are known to offer superior price performance than competitors. Here are some more reasons why the company may prove to be a surprise AI winner in 2025. AMD's data center business is experiencing robust momentum, driven by solid demand for its EPYC server processors and Instinct AI accelerators. AMD accounted for 25.1% share of the server CPU market, up 2 percentage points year over year, as EPYC server processors continue to be in high demand from both cloud players and enterprise customers. All major cloud players are engaging with the company in the development of fifth-generation EPYC CPUs, codenamed \"Turin.\" EPYC processors are also in high demand from enterprise customers across a range of industries and functions. The company expects enterprise adoption of EPYC processors to further accelerate, as more than 150 server platforms  using these chips will become broadly available in the coming quarters. The company's data center AI business is also gaining traction. Multiple Tier 1 cloud and enterprise customers have opted for AMD's Instinct AI accelerators in the first quarter. These clients include one of the largest frontier model developers, which has deployed Instinct GPUs to cater to a significant portion of its daily AI inferencing workloads. AMD has also started sampling the next-generation MI350 series GPUs with several customers and is on track for production by mid-2025. With MI350 offering higher performance, memory capacity, bandwidth, support for new data types, and network efficiency as compared to the MI300 series, AMD expects strong deployment for these chips in the second half of 2025. Furthermore, the company is gearing up for the launch of MI400 series GPUs in 2026. AMD is also focusing on strengthening its software ecosystem, mainly its ROCm software stack for programming the company's GPUs. Instead of releasing quarterly ROCm updates, the company is now delivering them on a biweekly basis. The company has also increased access to its Instinct compute infrastructure for open-source developers to build, test, and deploy updates to the ROCm stack on a nightly basis. Subsequently, 2 million models on the open-source Hugging Face platform are running directly on AMD hardware without needing any special customization. The company is also ensuring that newly released AI models can run without hiccups on Instinct accelerators immediately after launch. Finally, the recent acquisition of ZT Systems is enabling AMD to sell fully integrated AI systems, instead of just hardware components. All these AI initiatives can dramatically expand AMD's data center business in the coming years. AMD's client segment also reported a strong 68% year-over-year revenue jump to $2.3 billion in the first quarter. The company experienced record client CPU average selling prices (ASPs), driven by increased demand for its high-end desktop and Ryzen processors in gaming and commercial segments. While AMD's processors are increasingly adopted in gaming desktops, the company is also seeing rising demand in the mobile computing market. Furthermore, sales of the company's latest-generation AI-capable processors also grew more than 50% quarter over quarter in the first quarter. AMD is also making its presence felt in the commercial PC space, with the company closing deals with large enterprises across several industries. Despite the solid tailwinds, AMD's shares are currently trading at 21.7 times forward earnings, significantly lower than Nvidia's forward P/E multiple  of 25.4. While investors should not ignore the short-term revenue headwind arising from the export control restrictions for Instinct MI308 shipments to China, the fundamentals of the company are still strong. Hence, with a diversified product portfolio spanning various segments such as data center, gaming, and client; a robust balance sheet with $7.3 billion in cash; and a reasonable valuation position, AMD appears an attractive pick now.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Oracle Corp. ORCL. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corp. by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Humain, the query arises on AMD\u2019s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let\u2019s analyze. Several semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals. AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn\u2019t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million. NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration\u2019s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China. Thus, it\u2019s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corp. analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD\u2019s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years. Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA\u2019s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can\u2019t afford NVIDIA\u2019s pricey products. Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That\u2019s why Microsoft Corp. is using AMD\u2019s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corp. has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chips. While these factors may increase AMD\u2019s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA\u2019s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA\u2019s quarterly performance, driving up its share price. This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA\u2019s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93. Whereas, brokers have increased AMD\u2019s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?). While AMD may not surpass NVIDIA\u2019s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management\u2019s optimism about the company\u2019s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock. However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company\u2019s first-quarter results benefited from robust Data Center and Client revenues that fully offset sluggishness in the Gaming and Embedded segments. Data centers benefited from solid adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises. New product launches, such as the Ryzen 9 9950 X3D and Radeon 9070 series, also bolstered results. Gross margin expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by a more diverse Ryzen mix. AMD\u2019s expanding partner base including Microsoft, Oracle, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro has been a key catalyst. It has also expanded its portfolio through acquisitions. However, AMD has been suffering from stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA. Export controls on certain Instinct GPUs to China posed a regulatory challenge. (You can read the full research report on AMD here >>> ) Union Pacific\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-6.1% vs. -4.8%). The company is suffering as e-commerce sales have normalized and consumer markets have softened. Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment. Reduced fuel surcharge revenues, too, are a concern. Due to these headwinds, volumes are suffering. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) remains under pressure, mainly due to revenue woes. Given the soft freight market scenario, the revenue weakness is likely to persist. To combat the revenue weakness, UNP is looking to cut costs. In the meantime, UNP continues paying dividends. UNP is also active on the buyback front. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point. Our thesis is supported by the Neutral recommendation on the stock. (You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>> ) Shares of Lowe's have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past year (-1.6% vs. +4.6%). The company is facing challenges like market risks, intense competition, and a decline in DIY spending. Anticipated softness in comparable sales, margin pressure, and financial strain due to high debt may hinder performance. The Zacks analyst projects a 2% decline in comparable sales for the first quarter, with an adjusted operating margin contraction of 60 basis points. Nevertheless, Lowe's has implemented a comprehensive Pro-focused strategy, emphasizing improved product availability, timely delivery, and an expanded assortment, complemented by a rewards program. Strategic growth initiatives such as store expansion and enhanced customer experiences aim to position the company as a top omnichannel retailer. Investments in service offerings, operational efficiency, and long-term drivers like sustained home improvement demand support growth and profitability.

This microcap company with market capitalization of $52.46 million have seen Strong OEM relationships provide revenue stability, but profitability is declining, with a $0.9 million net loss in the first nine months of 2024 due to rising COGS and G&A expenses. Cash reserves fell to $0.5 million, raising liquidity concerns. Debt covenant violations led to reduced credit availability and higher interest rates while rising debt and interest costs added financial strain for the company. Nevertheless, Syntec Optics secured $2.1 million in new space optics orders, benefiting from strong LEO satellite demand. The company is restarting high-precision laser guidance optics production in Q1 2025, reinforcing its defense role amid rising global military budgets. Its presence in the expanding photonics industry supports growth across healthcare, communications, and automation, while government incentives for domestic manufacturing could boost contracts.

The outperformance can be attributed to AMD\u2019s expanding portfolio, accretive acquisitions and rich partner base. The strong adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises have also been major growth drivers for its success. So, how should you play the AMD stock now? Let\u2019s dig deep to find out. AMD\u2019s expanding EPYC portfolio has been noteworthy. In April 2025, AMD announced that Alphabet's GOOGL cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, has introduced new C4D and H4D virtual machines powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors. Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud\u2019s C4D instances deliver up to 80% higher throughput per vCPU, while Google Cloud\u2019s H4D VMs offer scalable performance for HPC workloads with Cloud RDMA. These advancements underscore Google Cloud\u2019s commitment to leveraging AMD\u2019s Zen 5 architecture for enhanced cloud computing capabilities. AMD\u2019s expanding portfolio in the embedded market has been a key catalyst for growth. In the first quarter of 2025, AMD introduced the EPYC Embedded 9005 Series processors, offering server-grade performance and energy efficiency, along with purpose-built features tailored for the networking, storage, and industrial edge markets. A rich partner base that includes Alphabet, Oracle ORCL, Meta Platforms, Dell Technologies, Cisco Systems, Jio Platforms, Nokia and IBM has been playing a key part in expanding AMD\u2019s footprint. In the first quarter of 2025, leading hyperscalers, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud, expanded their use of AMD EPYC CPUs. AMD announced that its 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors now power Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute E6 Standard shapes. Oracle utilizes these processors to deliver up to 2X the performance of the previous generation at the same cost. AMD expanded its partnership with Dell Technologies to deliver advanced AI solutions and enhance infrastructure. In the reported quarter, AMD announced its collaboration with Dell Technologies to deliver AI-ready solutions for the telecom industry, featuring the Instinct MI300X accelerator to power scalable, high-performance network infrastructures. AMD is also benefiting from accretive acquisitions to strengthen its AI ecosystem and bridge the technological gap with NVIDIA NVDA in the race for AI dominance. Exiting first-quarter 2025, AMD completed its acquisition of ZT Systems, combining its leadership in systems and racks with AMD\u2019s powerful GPUs, CPUs, networking silicon, and open-source software to tap into the $500 billion data center AI accelerator market by 2028. Despite an expanding portfolio and a rich partner base, AMD is expected to be hurt by export restrictions on GPUs to China, which will be a headwind and stiff competition from NVIDIA. AMD expects second-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.4 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 27%. AMD expects approximately $700 million reduction in second-quarter 2025 revenues due to halted MI308X shipments to China. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD\u2019s second-quarter 2025 earnings is currently pegged at 65 cents per share, which has decreased 35% over the past 30 days, indicating a year-over-year decline of 5.80%. The consensus mark for second-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $7.41 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.99%. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote AMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.30%. AMD stock is currently overvalued, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment. The stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 5.53X compared with the industry\u2019s 3.31X. AMD\u2019s expanding portfolio, strategic acquisitions and rich partner base are expected to improve its top-line growth. However, its near-term prospects are dull due to macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA in the cloud data center and AI chip markets. The growing demand for custom AI chips, offered by companies like Broadcom, is increasing concerns over market share. Stretched valuation also remains a concern. AMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

The chipmaker announced a significant expansion of its share buyback program this week and revealed a massive deal with a Saudi Arabian artificial intelligence (AI) company. AMD's board of directors approved $6 billion in additional share buybacks, supplementing the company's existing $4 billion repurchase authorization. The expanded program signals leadership's confidence in AMD's direction and financial health amid the ongoing AI boom. \"Our expanded share repurchase program reflects the Board's confidence in AMD's strategic direction, growth prospects, and ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow,\" CEO Lisa Su said in a statement. Image source: Getty Images. On Tuesday, a day before the buyback program was announced, AMD revealed an investment deal potentially worth $10 billion with Humain, a Saudi Arabian AI company. Su visited Saudi Arabia this week to finalize the agreement, which will see AMD provide GPUs integral to Humain's AI applications and the CPUs also needed to run the GPU-laden AI servers. While Nvidia remains the dominant AI chipmaker, the new deal with Humain shows AMD is capable of landing major contracts. It has been in a race to develop GPUs that can compete with Nvidia's powerful offerings, and while it can't match its rival's latest and most advanced chips, it is hoping to capture the still significant market for a more affordable option. While I don't think AMD will be rivaling Nvidia for the top spot anytime soon, this week's announcements show the company is capable of making the kinds of deals it needs to drive significant growth, and its stock is currently priced better than its rival's.

The agreement includes $142 billion in defense sales to help supply the country with \"state-of-the-art warfighting equipment.\" However, the two biggest winners are U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . Following Trump's announcement, both companies revealed deals to provide chips to Humain, a Saudi Arabian start-up owned by the kingdom's public investment fund. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia announced it will supply Humain with several hundred thousand of its most advanced over the next five years to help power the AI data centers the company will begin building in Saudi Arabia. It will begin by shipping 18,000 of its GB300 Grace Blackwell AI supercomputer chips, while it will also provide InfiniBand networking equipment. In addition, the Saudi Data & AI Authority (SDAIA) will deploy up to 5,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enable smart city solutions. Nvidia will also help train thousands of developers in the country and deploy the country's first Omniverse Cloud to simulate and test physical AI solutions. Bank of America analysts estimated that the deal could be worth between $15 billion to $20 billion in total spending over the length of the agreement. That would equal $3 billion to $5 billion in annual sales. In addition, the U.S. is reportedly close to easing chip export restrictions on the United Arab Emirates. The deal would let the nation import 500,000 advanced AI chips a year through at least 2027. About 20% of the chips would go to Abu Dhabi AI company G42, with the rest distributed to U.S. companies building data centers in the country. The deals should help replace some of the company's lost revenue to China, after the U.S. tightened export controls to the country. China accounted for about $17 billion of Nvidia's revenue last fiscal year, but it said it was down to mid-single digits of its data center revenue in fiscal Q4. Based on its Q4 run rate, that would be about $7 billion a year. AMD, meanwhile, announced it had struck a $10 billion deal with Humain to supply chips to the company over the next five years. AMD said it will provide the full spectrum of its AI compute portfolio, which seemingly means both GPUs and . It also signed a memorandum of understanding with SDAIA to explore using AMD chips to power future AI-focused data centers. When it reported its Q1 results, AMD noted that it would take a $700 million hit in revenue in Q2 due to new Chinese export restrictions and $1.5 billion for the year. With the Humain deal being worth $2 billion a year, that should replace much of this lost revenue. In addition to the deals helping replace lost Chinese revenue, they also mark what could be one of the next big growth drivers for the chipmakers: sovereign AI investments. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are clearly looking to invest in AI and data centers, but they are not the only countries. Just within the Middle East, Kuwait has partnered with Microsoft to help position the company as a regional AI leader. Bahrain and Qatar are also spending to build out AI infrastructure in their countries. Outside of the Middle East, India has partnerships with the big three companies to help scale its AI infrastructure. Even smaller countries like Singapore are allocating money toward AI. Meanwhile, it seems like President Trump is willing to use the AI semiconductor dominance of the U.S. as a bargaining chip in trade deals. As the U.S. negotiates a new trade deal with China, perhaps the recent chip restrictions could even be rescinded. Both Nvidia and AMD are well-positioned to benefit from increased AI infrastructure spending. Nvidia is the clear leader in the GPU space with an over 80% market share, and should continue to see strong growth as data center spending continues to ramp up. Meanwhile, AMD has proven to be a leader when it comes to supplying CPUs for data centers. It's also carved a nice niche in the GPU market for .

Per McKinsey's analysis, spending on AI infrastructure could reach $6.7 trillion by 2030. Among these different infrastructure opportunities, McKinsey estimates that nearly $3.1 trillion will be allocated toward chip designers for AI-equipped data centers. Let's analyze which companies are making major investments in AI infrastructure right now and explore what they're investing in. From there, I'll reveal my top four data center stocks to load up on right now and explain why. Investors don't need to look much further than the \"Magnificent Seven\" to buy into McKinsey's forecast around rising AI-related capex. For the last couple of years, Microsoft , Alphabet , and Amazon have been shelling out billions, partnering with high-profile businesses such as OpenAI (maker of ChatGPT) and . Data by . Integrating (LLMs) and generative AI into their respective ecosystems has supercharged growth for megacap tech -- especially in areas such as cybersecurity, workplace productivity software, and cloud computing infrastructure. Just this year alone, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are forecast to . Per the commentary of their respective management teams, much of this spend will be allocated toward chips and outfitting AI data centers -- just as McKinsey is calling for. In addition to the cloud hyperscalers above, Meta Platforms recently told investors that it is actually raising its capex budget for 2025. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, Meta has proven to be a big buyer of chips over these last few years. Additionally, each of these Magnificent Seven members has also been exploring their own custom silicon. With this backdrop, here are four companies that stand to benefit from these AI infrastructure tailwinds. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to AI chip designers, my top two picks are Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . Per industry estimates, Nvidia is estimated to hold 90% (or more) of the AI GPU market with AMD comprising much of the remainder. Considering each company I referenced above currently , the capex spend for this year should be a major tailwind for both chip stocks. Moreover, Broadcom stands to benefit from rising AI infrastructure spend in a couple of ways. First, the company specializes in outfitting data centers with networking equipment needed to house GPU clusters. Broadcom can also lend a hand in the area of custom silicon (which it's currently doing already with Meta). Lastly, and perhaps the most lucrative opportunity of all, is . Taiwan Semi specializes in the fabrication processes needed to actually make the chips designed by Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and more. Among Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and TSMC, each company plays a mission-critical role in the development of AI-powered services. Given the spending patterns from AI's biggest players appear to be very much still in motion, all four of these semiconductor stocks are well positioned for accelerated growth for years to come. The chart below illustrates the (P/E) multiples for Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, and TSMC. Data by . There has been a considerable drop in the forward P/E ratios for these companies in recent months. Much of this valuation compression has to do with uncertainty around President Trump's new tariff policies. While some progress appears to have been made, it's still a fluid situation. In my eyes, many investors are sitting on the sidelines right now -- waiting to see what management teams at these companies have to say in terms of over the next quarter or second half of the year. As a long-term investor, I'm not overly concerned about what the next couple of quarters may look like. Rather, I'm more keyed into the secular themes fueling AI growth right now. As McKinsey models in its reporting, spending on AI infrastructure -- particularly chips and data centers -- should continue to experience robust growth over the next several years. For these reasons, I would take advantage of any weakness among these chip stocks and prepare to hold on tight. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

From to a steady stream of economic data releases centered around inflation and jobs growth, it can be easy for something important to fall through the cracks. On Thursday, May 15, arguably one of the most important data dumps of the quarter occurred -- and it's possible you missed it. May 15 marked the deadline for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F allows everyday investors to track which stocks Wall Street's leading money managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter (in this instance, the first quarter of 2025). Although 13Fs have their limitations -- they're up to 45 days old when filed, and therefore might present a stale picture for an active hedge fund -- they can provide invaluable insight into the stocks, industries, sectors, and trends that have the full attention of Wall Street's most-successful asset managers. Image source: Getty Images. While when investors peruse the trading activity of Wall Street's top money managers, he's far from the only prominent investor. Appaloosa Management's David Tepper, who oversees north of $8.3 billion in AUM, has an exceptional investing acumen of his own. Tepper and his team are fairly active, with Appaloosa's top-20 holdings held for just over an average of two years. But he and his team are particularly active in the tech sector. During the first quarter, Tepper continued a recent theme and sent more than half of his fund's shares of darling Nvidia to the chopping block, all while loading up on another market-leading AI stock. . Accounting for Nvidia's historic 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024, Tepper's fund held 4.42 million shares of Nvidia, as of March 31, 2024. One year later, this position is down to just 300,000 shares, with Appaloosa's 13F showing that Tepper disposed of 380,001 shares in the first quarter, which represents a 56% sequential quarterly reduction. The all-important question is: Why is Tepper selling shares of Wall Street's leading AI-graphics processing unit (GPU) developer? It's quite possible this persistent selling is nothing more than Appaloosa's chief locking in gains on a stock that was first purchased in early 2023 and has skyrocketed since then. But it's also possible than just simple profit-taking. For one, competition is picking up in a big way for Nvidia. Direct rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and China-based Huawei are developing next-generation AI-GPUs of their own for sale in high-compute data centers. Yet the . Most of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing AI chips to use in their data centers. While these chips are mostly viewed as complementary to Nvidia's hardware, they're notably cheaper and more readily accessible (i.e., they're not backlogged like Nvidia's AI-GPUs). This creates a scenario where Nvidia can lose out on future data center real estate to these internally developed chips. To build on this point, we're already witnessing evidence that competition is : its pricing power. In early 2024, Nvidia's Hopper (H100) chip was commanding north of $40,000, compared to $10,000 to $15,000 per chip for AMD's Instinct series chips. But as competition has manifested in the AI arena, Nvidia's gross margin has declined in each quarter since peaking a year ago. The other concern that may be warranting David Tepper's ongoing sale of Nvidia stock is the role history has played in next-big-thing investments for more than three decades. Since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, during its early expansion. This occurs because investors consistently overestimate the adoption and utility of a next-generation technology or innovation. With most businesses lacking a clear AI game plan and/or not optimizing their AI solutions as of yet, the likelihood of an AI bubble brewing appears to be high. No company would be more directly hit if the AI bubble bursts than Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Though Appaloosa's 13F depicts more selling than buying activity during the March-ended quarter, David Tepper did pick out more than a half-dozen new stocks to add to his fund. Perhaps none stands out more than the 130,000 shares purchased of AI-networking specialist Broadcom . Broadcom's stock began to soar roughly two years ago when it introduced its Jericho3-AI fabric, which connects up to 32,000 GPUs at once. Broadcom's solutions aim to maximize the compute potential of the hardware in an enterprise AI data center, all while minimizing tail latency, which is critical for the split-second decisions being made by AI software and systems. If an AI bubble were to form and burst, Broadcom wouldn't be immune. , and a bubble-bursting event could very well encourage businesses to taper their spending on GPUs and networking solutions. But unlike Nvidia, , and would therefore be expected to handily outperform Wall Street's AI darling in a worst-case scenario. For instance, Broadcom is . Even though smartphones aren't the growth story they once were, the expansion of 5G wireless networks leads to relatively steady demand for Broadcom's chips. Broadcom has its proverbial fingers in a number of other key industries that would help partially insulate it in the event of an AI bubble. It provides a wide assortment of networking and optical solutions for next-generation vehicles, has solutions for enhancing industrial automation, offers cybersecurity solutions, and even has products for medical systems and equipment. Another reason Tepper may be loading up on Broadcom is its gross margin. Unlike Nvidia, which has seen its gross margin dip over the last year, Broadcom's been consistently climbing over the trailing-12-month period. Higher margins usually translate into earnings growing at an even faster pace than sales. Lastly, first-quarter weakness in Broadcom's stock opened the door for David Tepper to potentially scoop up shares at roughly 23 times in March, which was near a two-year low.

Nvidia shot higher amid surprisingly strong demand for AI accelerators, and recently, Palantir 's valuation has reached nosebleed levels as its software delivers notable productivity breakthroughs. Still, this success has not applied to all , and many appear . That creates a possible opportunity in companies that investors may have overlooked, increasing the odds that you can generate outsized returns by investing in artificial intelligence. To this end, investors may want to take a closer look at Alphabet , Advanced Micro Devices , and Qualcomm . Image source: Getty Images. It may surprise some investors to see Google parent Alphabet selling at a of 19. The company is an AI pioneer, first applying the technology in 2001. Moreover, it is one of the more cash-rich businesses in existence, generating $75 billion in over the last 12 months and holding $95 billion in . Still, skepticism about the stock likely relates to the lucrative search business that generated much of that cash. Competition from ChatGPT took its market share in search below 90% for the first time in years, according to Oberlo. However, Alphabet has long made it a goal to become less reliant on search and the corresponding ad business. To that end, advertising was 74% of revenue in the first quarter of 2025, down from 77% in the year-ago quarter. Google Cloud raised its revenue share to 14%, growing from 12% over the same period. Additionally, Alphabet owns numerous businesses, some of which could emerge as primary revenue sources. One of these is autonomous vehicle company Waymo, which investors recently valued at $45 billion during a funding round. Ultimately, when considering the cash position and business, a 19 P/E ratio is a low price to pay for such optionality. AMD may be one of the more surprising stocks to be overlooked. It is arguably the most prominent CPU maker, pulling ahead of longtime leader Intel . Also, even though it lags Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, it looks increasingly like a rising player in that industry. Still, investors have sold off the stock in recent months as its gaming and embedded segments suffered. Even with a partial recovery, it sells at an approximate 50% discount from its all-time high in early 2024. Nonetheless, the stock's long-term investors may now see signs of hope. In the first quarter of 2025, revenue of $7.4 billion increased by 36% yearly, far above the 2% annual increase in the year-ago quarter. Its data center and client segments remained robust, growing revenue by 57% and 68%, respectively. Also, the embedded segment has begun to pare losses, with its annual decline down to 3%. Moreover, the 30% yearly decline in gaming revenue is an improvement over past quarters, likely meaning these segments are finally emerging from their down cycles. Finally, while its 86 trailing P/E ratio may look pricey, a of 29 may make the stock inexpensive, given the company's improving revenue growth. That means the recent rise in the stock price should probably continue. Another AI stock that suffers from negative sentiment is Qualcomm. The smartphone chipset giant faces some notable headwinds with its extensive ties to China and the decision by Apple to develop chipsets in-house. Nonetheless, one can argue that the stock price accounts for these factors (and then some). The stock trades at just 16 times earnings, and the forward P/E ratio of 13 indicates its profit growth will continue. Moreover, 's breakthrough earlier this year offers lower-cost AI technology, presumably making AI accessible to more users. That bodes well for Qualcomm's chipset business, which has begun to benefit from an AI-driven upgrade cycle. The chipset business was the primary reason its revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended March 30) rose 17% annually to $11 billion. Furthermore, Qualcomm has made strides in its Internet of Things and automotive businesses. These enterprises grew revenue on a yearly basis by 27% and 59%, respectively, which bodes well for Qualcomm's efforts to prepare for a day when smartphones are less critical to consumers. Indeed, the ties to China and Apple's decision to drop Qualcomm have likely pressured Qualcomm stock. Still, considering the low P/E ratio and fast growth of its businesses, the stock looks increasingly like a buy.

Today\u2019s homework comes from those at Morningstar, a team of analysts and investors who have landed on some , rooted in fundamentals that account for today\u2019s volatile and uncertain environment in the S&P 500 brought on by the recent rollout of trade tariffs from President Trump . Despite all of this uncertainty, these picks have enough reason to make them winners for investors who can successfully break apart the reasoning behind these names for themselves. The top picks laid out by Morningstar when it comes to value stocks are stocks like , , and even . All of these are focused on the of the United States. Still, there are other commonalities that they share in the sense that they offer fantastic risk-to-reward ratios for investors to consider moving forward, as well as strong fundamentals in the global economy. Not all software companies are equal. Some are cyclical and see their financials hover between upper and lower ranges, along with the business and spending cycle in the economy. Others don\u2019t really care what most consumers are thinking since they rely on recurring sources of revenue like subscriptions. Adobe fits in the latter category , as almost all (90% or so) of its revenue comes from subscription services in its software offerings. Apart from this fundamental business model setup, Adobe\u2019s products are also at the heart of the digitalization of the global economy today. From Photoshop to Premiere Pro , the online economy and businesses looking to build their social media and online presence will continue to look to Adobe for the solutions they need. Adobe stock has traded down to only 71% of its 52-week high , officially in a bear market by Wall Street's definition. These Morningstar analysts aren\u2019t alone in their views for Adobe though, as allocators from Amundi decided to boost their holdings in Adobe stock by as much as 24.7% as of mid May 2025, netting their position at a high of . As shares of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, have fallen to 81% of their 52-week highs , the worst might have already been priced into this tech giant. Despite the tariff volatility that has hit the technology sector, Alphabet has the ingredients to bring investors out of this storm with some green in their portfolios. By pivoting from its main business as a search engine and online advertising, Alphabet's new pursuit of quantum computing and autonomous driving through Waymo has given investors something new to think about. In states like California, Waymo is already making major breakthroughs in transportation, essentially giving the company a head start and an advantage over other competitors in the space. More than that, large language models (LLMs) and the artificial intelligence platforms that everyone knows about indirectly rely on Alphabet as a major source of information. This is why Morningstar sees it as a value play\u00a0and why Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial , considers the stock a Strong Buy with a valuation . This view would dare of as much as 42% from today\u2019s prices, and it makes all the sense today. Advanced Micro Devices has fallen behind other big names in terms of popularity in the semiconductor and chipmaking industry. However, its current risk-to-reward setup is one of the best in the space today. At only 63% of its 52-week high , this stock does not have much downside to price, and all of the upside is still intact for investors to consider. This might be one of the reasons short sellers decided to start scaling out of the stock, as seen in the over the past month alone, a clear sign of bearish capitulation as the traders realize the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze today. It seems that Amundi isn\u2019t just bullish on Adobe. They also boosted their stakes in Advanced Micro Devices by as much as 8% as of mid-May 2025, bringing their exposure to a in another wave of discounted technology buying to show confidence in where these stocks could go from here.

This is still the most important theme in the entire market. Yes, there are other themes. Yes, there are other sectors doing well, but absent AI, there\u2019s just no chance that we would have pulled this this spring out of the hole the way that we have, and that\u2019s because of the affirmed guidance.\u201d That said, a report from Silicon Valley Bank has revealed how venture capital firms focused on artificial intelligence are behind much of the growth in the startup market. Meanwhile, companies in other areas are struggling to raise cash. \u201cExclude AI investment and the story changes. There is no meaningful uptick for companies not leveraging AI, with investment from this group essentially flat for the last year.\u201d For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

On May 20, Citi analyst Christopher Danely reiterated a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating on the stock with a $100.00 price target. The reiteration follows AMD\u2019s announcement yesterday that it will divest the ZT Systems manufacturing business to Sanmina for $3 billion, following its $4.6 billion acquisition of ZT back in August. The analyst told investors in a research note how AMD had already announced at the time of acquisition that it would acquire ZT but sell off the manufacturing piece, retaining engineers to better compete with Nvidia. Citi had expected this acquisition to be around $5 billion. As such, the ZT Systems acquisition should allow the company to better compete with Nvidia in the data center GPU market through additional system experience and faster hyperscaler deployment times.

While it affirms decision to open the NVLINK system to other manufacturers with NVLINK Fusion , the CPU market is already dominated by Intel and , which are unlikely to sit still. NVIDIA\u2019s role is critical; letting 3rd-party manufacturers embed NVLink hardware into their systems allows AI developers to build semi-custom AI infrastructure faster and more efficiently for data processing than previous systems. What percent of market share can Qualcomm gain from the datacenter CPU market ? The market is estimated at roughly $14.15 billion in 2025, so for its business would take a significant gain . That is possible due to NVIDIA\u2019s industry-leading position with AI GPUs, but the real opportunity is to establish another revenue stream to help diversify the business. Capturing the robust growth projected for the industry and a position in the replacement/upgrade cycle would be a win for Qualcomm. Analysts see the global data center industry growing at a moderately high single-digit CAGR through the middle of the next decade for a net gain of over 110%. As it is, Intel commands about 75% of the market and AMD nearly the remainder, so it will be a tough market to crack. Qualcomm\u2019s re-entry into the CPU market with NVIDIA-compatible products was . MarketBeat tracked no revisions or commentary within the first 24 hours of the announcement, the critical period for market-moving analyst activity. The takeaway for inventors is that Qualcomm is rated as a weak Hold , sentiment is deteriorating with downgrades in 2025, and the price target is trending lower. The consensus reported by MarketBeat in mid-May forecasts a 25% upside , but the revision trend forecasts a move into the low-end range near $150 . Analysts' sentiment is driven by that is unchanged by the news. The analysts forecast about 10% revenue growth in 2025 , then a much slower, roughly 2.5% CAGR through the decade's end. The only truly bullish news is that the capital return and capital return growth outlook remain intact, including the dividend and share repurchases. The dividend annualizes to more than 2.25% with shares trading at the low end of the analysts\u2019 range, and buybacks are substantial. Repurchases in FQ2/CQ1 2025 reduced the count by 1.3% year-over-year and by about 1% on a year-to-date basis . Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet and value gains are another bonus for investors and long-term holders . The company\u2019s balance sheet is a fortress capable of sustaining the capital return for the foreseeable future. The details at the end of FQ2 included flat assets and debt, reduced total liability, and increased equity. Equity was up nearly 6% with long-term debt less than 0.5x and a solid cash balance, about 0.5x the debt . The company is on track for inclusion in the Dividend Aristocrats Index in 2030, but the CAGR is slowing. The last increases were mid-single-digit amounts, but investors should expect them to slow into the low-single-digit range . The price action in QCOM stock of May and may continue to advance in Q2. However, the market is range-bound and at a critical inflection point within the range that may cap the move. That is a cluster of moving averages that coincide with a previous support level.

According to the U.S. published guidance, companies risk violating export controls if found using Ascend AI chips from Shenzhen-based Huawei. In response, China\u2019s commerce ministry said there could be \u201ccorresponding legal liabilities\u201d against those involved in implementing U.S. measures and that it constitutes \u201cdiscriminatory restrictive measures\u201d against Chinese firms. READ ALSO: and . The sanctions are seemingly a new strategy adopted by the US to curb China\u2019s progress in the AI arms race. The world is yet to watch the success of this strategy as opposed to the AI diffusion rule imposed earlier, which the world came to know had failed miserably after the arrival of DeepSeek. Even Jensen Huang has deemed the AI diffusion rule to be a failure. \u201cAll in all, the export control was a failure. The fundamental assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule in the beginning, in the first place, has been proven to be fundamentally flawed.\u201d In fact, the sales block advanced AI chips to China, forcing companies to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers. It also pushed the country to invest aggressively in a robust supply chain that doesn\u2019t rely on manufacturers outside the country. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.

Keep reading to see two Nasdaq-100 stocks I'd buy without hesitation. Image source: Getty Images. Share prices of The Trade Desk plunged earlier this year after the ad tech company missed its fourth-quarter guidance. Management was direct with investors about the miss, saying it was due to a few internal errors and delays, rather than competition or a structural change in the market. The company redeemed itself in its first-quarter earnings report, blowing past estimates. Revenue jumped 25% year over year to $616 million, ahead of estimates at $575.3 million. The Trade Desk has been a longtime outperformer on the stock market, and the company has several competitive advantages as the leading independent demand-side platform in ad tech. It's invested significantly in AI, and two-thirds of its customers are now using its Kokai AI platform, with the majority of its customer spend now going through Kokai. The technology has the power to look across roughly 17 million ad opportunities per second, and management believes it will be the most powerful buying platform the advertising industry has ever seen by the end of the year. The ad tech platform also appears to be in an advantageous position as pressure builds on Alphabet 's Google, whose \"walled garden\" commands a large share of ad spend that demand-side platforms like The Trade Desk don't get to participate in. Google has been declared an illegal monopoly in U.S. District Court for both search and ad tech, and the company could face a significant fine, forced divestitures, or a breakup. A setback for Google should favor The Trade Desk. Over the long term, The Trade Desk seems well-positioned to take advantage of tailwinds in the digital advertising market and deliver strong growth. Even after the recent rebound, the stock is down 46%, offering plenty of room for recovery. Like The Trade Desk, Advanced Micro Devices is also trading down sharply from its peak. The stock was bid up significantly in the earlier stages of the AI boom. While AMD didn't live up to those expectations back then, the business is thriving now, and the stock is much cheaper. Revenue jumped 36% year over year in the first quarter to $7.44 billion, and importantly, its data center segment is taking off, driven in part by AI demand. In the first quarter, data center revenue jumped 57% to $3.7 billion, driven by growth of EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU chips. AMD's momentum also seems to be building in other areas. It signed a $10 billion collaboration deal with Humain, a Saudi Arabian AI company. It also acquired ZT Systems and sold off the infrastructure business, retaining its engineers, which should better position it to compete in the data center market, according to analysts, and Elon Musk said his XAi startup was planning to buy \"a lot\" of GPUs from AMD and Nvidia . In addition, AMD announced a $6 billion share repurchase authorization, showing it's prepared to take advantage of any discounts or sell-offs in the stock. After the pullback over the past year, AMD now trades at a of under 30 based on adjusted earnings. For a company that's emerging as a clear winner from the AI boom, that looks like a great price.

As of this writing, the benchmark index is now basically flat across 2025's trading. That's an impressive feat given some dramatic sell-offs that roiled the market earlier in the year and almost pushed it into bear market territory. But while some stocks have seen huge valuation rebounds and gone on to trade at new highs or reach pricing in the neighborhood of previous peaks, there are still several promising stocks trading at substantial discounts. If you're on the hunt for stocks that look like great long-term investments, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think these discounted stocks have what it takes to deliver big wins for your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. : Excitement surrounding the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution helped push Advanced Micro Devices stock to a lifetime high in March 2024, but sales growth and margins for the company's AI processors since then wound up disappointing many investors. As a result, the semiconductor specialist's share price is down 46% from its all-time high. But I think AMD will still be able to score wins in AI and reward patient shareholders. To be clear, Nvidia retains a significant lead in most aspects of high-end AI processing hardware. The company's CUDA software platform is also the industry standard for getting the most out of processors when developing the foundations for AI models and applications. As a result, there's a good chance that AMD will have a hard time catching up to Nvidia at the high end of the market any time soon. On the other hand, AMD doesn't necessarily need to unseat Nvidia at the bleeding edge of AI processors in order to deliver strong returns for investors. With its Q1 earnings report, AMD posted a gross margin of 50% -- up from the 47% margin it recorded in last year's quarter. Increasing sales contributions from processors for data centers helped power the margin improvement. For comparison, Nvidia reported a gross margin of 78.4% in its first quarter. There's little chance of AMD recording a gross margin that high within the foreseeable future, but investors shouldn't be overly fixated on that comparative shortcoming. The AI processor market will likely continue to grow at a rapid pace, and it should be able to support more than one winner. As AI models and applications become more efficient and refined, the processing power needed to train and run a wide range of artificial intelligence systems should diminish. There will likely still be huge rewards for winners at the forefront of the technology, but the broader AI software category will expand and create a bigger market for midrange processing that offers cost-effective results. Even if AMD continues to be second-fiddle in the AI processor market, this creates a path for its stock to deliver market-crushing returns for shareholders. Lee Samaha : Industrial software company PTC 's stock price is down 8% in 2025 and 16% from its all-time high. The decline is due to deteriorating near-term market conditions, but that shouldn't detract from the fundamental attractiveness of its solutions or its long-term ability to grow its annual run rate (ARR) of active subscriptions and contracts and its free cash flow ( ). The company's computer-aided design (CAD) and product lifecycle management (PLM) software lie at the heart of the digitization of manufacturing, and their value will only improve due to developments in AI, advanced analytics, and increased adoption of digital twins. Simply put, there's a revolution taking place in manufacturing whereby the physical world is being enhanced by actionable insights garnered through interaction with the digital world. Customers will still delay spending or take a more conservative approach to deploying investment in uncertain times. Unfortunately, the uncertainty in the economy due to the tariff conflict is causing PTC's customers to lengthen sales cycles and downsize deals. As such, PTC's management lowered its constant currency ARR growth guidance for 2025 from 9% to 10% to a new range of 7% to 9%. Frankly, this sort of thing is never good news. Still, on a more positive note, management raised its full-year FCF guidance to a range of $840 million to $850 million from a previous range of $835 million to $850 million due to excellent performance in the first half. Moreover, its FCF in 2025 is being negatively impacted by $19 million due to costs associated with the realignment of its sales and marketing operations (sales are being realigned around five key industry verticals).  Adding the $19 million back to the midpoint of the FCF range gives an underlying FCF of $864 million, which would put PTC at 22 times FCF in 2025. That's an extremely attractive multiple for a company growing ARR at a high-single-digit rate and FCF at a mid-teens rate. Moreover, it will look even better if there's a de-escalation in the trade conflict.

{"title": "Where Will AMD Stock Be in 3 Years?", "url": "https://finviz.com/news/65025/where-will-amd-stock-be-in-3-years", "source": "Motley Fool", "scraped_at": "2025-05-26T01:39:28.529731", "published_date": "2025-05-23T08:00:00", "body": "Advanced Micro Devices is an important player in the global semiconductor industry as its chips power multiple applications such as personal computers (PCs), gaming consoles, data center servers, and communications and aerospace equipment, among others. But its performance on the stock market has left a lot to be desired in the past three years. AMD stock has been weighed down by factors such as sharp declines in PC shipments in 2022 and 2023, the poor performance of its embedded business on account of tepid demand from telecom customers, and soft demand from the gaming segment. Additionally, the company's inability to corner a substantial chunk of the booming chip market, where Nvidia has established itself as the clear leader, has also dented investor confidence. All this explains why AMD stock has clocked just 17% gains in the past three years. That's way lower than the 68% jump in the Nasdaq Composite index over the same period. However, AMD's financial performance has been picking up pace in recent quarters thanks to a solid jump in sales of its PC and data center chips. But will the company be able to sustain this momentum over the next three years and deliver market-beating returns? AMD has witnessed a nice jump in its revenue and earnings in the past couple of years. This is evident from the chart below. data by This impressive turnaround can be attributed to the gradual recovery in the PC market, as well as AMD's entry into the data center graphics processing unit (GPU) space. Sales of PCs were up by 3.9% last year, and they are expected to head higher on the back of the growth in AI-enabled PCs and the end of support for Windows 10 PCs in October. Market research firm TechNavio is expecting the PC market to clock a compound annual growth rate of almost 8% through 2028. This suggests that the next three years for the PC market are likely to be much better than the last three. This is great news for AMD investors as the company's client central processing unit (CPU) business has been in fine form in recent quarters. For example, AMD's client segment revenue shot up an impressive 68% year over year in Q1 to $2.3 billion, accounting for 31% of its top line. This was extremely impressive when you consider that global PC shipments rose 6.7% year over year in Q1. AMD has been consistently gaining share in the client CPU market in recent quarters, and this explains why its growth significantly exceeded the broader market. According to Mercury Research, AMD's revenue share of the client CPU market shot up by more than 10 percentage points in the first quarter of 2025 to 26.5%. This was better than the increase of 3.5 percentage points in its unit share to 24.1%, suggesting that AMD is enjoying stronger pricing power for its processors. AMD's market share numbers also tell us that the company still has a lot of room for growth. Management remarked on the latest earnings conference call that it is confident it can grow \"client processor revenue well ahead of the market in 2025,\" a trend that's likely to continue over the next three years considering Intel , AMD's rival in this market. So, a combination of higher market share along with the PC market's recovery over the next three years could turn out to be a big growth driver for AMD. Meanwhile, AI data centers are boosting demand for AMD's server CPUs and GPUs. This explains why the company's data center revenue shot up an impressive 57% year over year in the first quarter of 2025 to $3.7 billion. Just like the client CPU market, AMD has been eating into Intel's share of data center CPUs. Its revenue share of the server CPU market increased by more than 6 percentage points in Q1 to 39.4%. Image source: Getty Images. There is a good chance that AMD will be able to corner a bigger share of the server CPU market in the future as major cloud computing providers and enterprise customers have been turning to this platform to power their data centers. Moreover, AMD believes that the launch of its next-generation server CPU platform, which will start shipping in the second half of the year, should continue to power the growth of this segment. This won't be surprising as the company estimates that the fifth-generation processors based on the Turin architecture could deliver 17% better performance while tackling enterprise and cloud workloads as compared to the previous generation processors. Even better, they are expected to deliver a 37% improvement in performance during AI and high-performance computing tasks. On the other hand, AMD's customer base for its data center GPUs is also expanding. The company is not only adding new customers for its Instinct series of data center graphics cards, but is also bringing new ones on board. The company's momentum in the data center GPU market could get better once it launches its upgraded MI350 accelerators this year. AMD is promising big performance gains by \"increasing memory capacity and bandwidth 1.5x, adding support for new data types, and improving network efficiency to deliver 35x higher throughput and performance compared to MI300x.\" Not surprisingly, AMD says that the demand for its upcoming AI GPUs is solid, with the likes of Oracle already set to deploy clusters powered by its new chips. Again, investors would do well to note that AMD doesn't need to become the biggest player in the AI GPU market. It could witness a significant jump in its data center GPU revenue over the next three years . AMD stock is currently trading at 28 times forward earnings, which is a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 31.5. What's more, the stock has a price/earnings-to-growth ratio ( ) of 0.58 based on its projected earnings growth over the next five years, according to Yahoo! Finance. A PEG ratio of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued when you take into account the growth it could deliver over the next five years. Not surprisingly, consensus estimates are projecting AMD's earnings to increase to $6.88 per share in 2027, which would be more than double its 2024 earnings of $3.31 per share. Assuming AMD trades at 27 times earnings after three years (in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple) and does hit the consensus earnings estimate, its stock price could jump to $188. That would be a 66% jump from current levels, suggesting that this could deliver a much-improved performance over the next three years.

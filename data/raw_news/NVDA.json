    "body": "The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week\u2019s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members. It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group. Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back. A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia\u2019s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia\u2019s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper. Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up. While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it. In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren\u2019t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows. With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues. You can see this Q1 earnings growth in the chart below, which also shows the deceleration in the Mag 7 group\u2019s earnings growth over the coming periods. Beyond Nvidia, the earnings focus will remain on big-box retailers, with Costco coming out with results. Costco has been a true category leader, with a higher-income customer group that is loyal to the company\u2019s value offerings. Costco is better positioned to navigate the uncertain tariff environment than many other retailers. The company\u2019s U.S. business accounts for more than 70% of its revenues, and two-thirds of the merchandise in Costco U.S. is sourced domestically. Of the imported merchandise, roughly one-third of the total comes from China, Mexico, and Canada combined, and no one country is a dominant supplier. Costco is expected to report $4.25 per share in earnings on $63.1 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +12.4% and +7.9%, respectively. Estimates have inched up since the quarter got underway, with the current $4.25 estimate up from $4.24 a month back and $4.23 two months ago. Costco\u2019s earnings and revenues in the current fiscal year (ends in August 2025) are expected to increase +11.5% and +7.9% from the preceding year\u2019s levels, respectively. The company remains well-positioned to sustain this growth momentum in the following year as well on the back of mid-single-digit comp growth and growth in membership fee income in high-single digits. No doubt, the stock has been a standout performer, handily outperforming the broader market (+10.3% vs. -1.2%) in the year-to-date period. With respect to the , we now have results from 28 of the 33 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification. The Zacks Retail sector includes Costco, Walmart, other traditional retailers, online vendors like Amazon AMZN, and restaurant players. Total Q1 earnings for these 28 retailers that have reported are up +11.2% from the same period last year on +5% higher revenues, with 60.7% beating EPS estimates and only 57.1% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. As you can see above, the EPS and revenue beats percentages for these companies are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies. Concerning the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 28 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +42.6% on +8.6% higher revenues, beating EPS and top-line expectations. As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the COVID-19 lockdowns. The two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon\u2019s results (left side chart) and without Amazon\u2019s numbers (right side chart). As you can see above, earnings for the group outside of Amazon are down -5% on a +3.8% top-line gain, which points to margin pressures for the group. The Q1 Earnings Scorecard Through Friday, May 23 , we have seen Q1 results from 478 S&P 500 members or 95.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. With less than two dozen S&P 500 members still to report results at this stage, the Q1 reporting cycle has actually ended for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with just a few companies still left to report for each of the remaining 6 sectors. Earnings for these 478 index members that have reported results are up +11.6% from the same period last year on +4.3% revenue gains, with 74.3% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 63% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates for these index members in a historical context. The comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. As you can see here, the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below historical averages, with the Q1 EPS beats percentage of 74.3% comparing to the average for the same group of 78.3% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). The Q1 revenue beats percentage of 63% compares to the 5-year average for this group of index members of 71.1%. Is the Turnaround in Estimates for Real? Looking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 478 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +12.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, which would follow the +14.1% earnings growth on +5.7% revenue gains in the preceding period. The chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2025 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters. We have been flagging consistently in recent weeks that estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, as you can see in the chart below. The magnitude of cuts to 2025 Q2 estimates since the start of the period is bigger and more widespread relative to what we have become used to seeing in the post-COVID period. But you have likely noticed in recent weeks that we have been pointing to signs of stabilization in Tech sector estimates, both for Q2 as well as full-year 2025. The chart below shows how Tech sector earnings estimates for the period appear to bottom in the second half of April, but may have started coming down again. We see this same trend at play in annual estimates as well. The chart below shows the Tech sector\u2019s evolving earnings expectations for full-year 2025. We knew something was up, as the early signs of these revision trends started showing up in the data. It may be premature to say that the trend has completely reversed. But it nevertheless shows that the revisions trend has stabilized. The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis.

This initiative focuses on developing next-gen power systems based on a new architecture that utilizes central power generation of 800 V high-voltage direct current/HVDC. The goal is to increase energy-efficient power distribution throughout the data center and enable direct power conversion at the AI chip/GPU within the server board. The 800V HVDC system architecture enhances reliability and efficiency, which is crucial as AI data centers are already exceeding 100,000 individual GPUs and are projected to require power outputs of 1MW or more per IT rack before the end of the decade. Infineon Technologies (OTC:IFNNY) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) emphasize that this collaboration will set a new industry standard for power architecture in AI data centers. Infineon's expertise in power conversion solutions is accelerating the adoption of this full-scale HVDC architecture. This approach contrasts with the current decentralized power supply using numerous power supply units and will optimize server rack space and enable upgrades to even higher distribution voltages.

    "body": "Not for the first time in their relatively brief existences, shot well higher in value on Thursday. That wasn't due to any fresh innovation, discovery, or major business move. Rather, it seemed to have more to do with some grand pronouncements by a single quantum company executive. Nevertheless, as a writer, I can confirm that words have power, and these were powerful enough to lift the sector as a whole. Industry standard-bearers Quantum Computing , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum all saw their share prices inflate at double-digit rates. The stocks rose a respective 15%, 24%, and 26% on the day. Those market-moving words came from the leader of one of their peers, IonQ . That morning, published an interview with the company's CEO, Niccolo de Masi, in which he waxed extremely bullish about the prospects for his business. This was clearly taken by the article's readers as likely prosperity for the wider quantum space. Image source: Getty Images. De Masi is clearly not the shy and publicity-adverse type of corporate leader, as he made a series of grand pronouncements about IonQ. In his eyes, the company is the quantum sector equivalent of graphics processing unit (GPU) king Nvidia or advanced processor specialist Broadcom . As such, IonQ's ultimate prominence and power will be imitated by businesses hoping to catch some of its magic. In fact, added the executive, \"they have always copied and followed us.\" That isn't really accurate, as the varied quantum companies currently traded on the stock market are following different paths to hoped-for success. In IonQ's case, it's a \"full-stack\" business, aiming to provide hardware, the software that runs on it, and applications for control and access. In a way, though, Quantum Computing, Rigetti, and D-Wave followers. IonQ was among the first pure-play quantum companies to become publicly traded. That pedigree is a factor that has helped drive its market cap to over $11 billion at present. That dwarfs its three peers, as the most richly capitalized of the trio -- D-Wave -- is currently valued by investors at under $5.6 billion. Nevertheless, investors should always be wary of hype, especially when applied to an early-stage industry struggling to get on its financial feet -- like quantum. While the technology has indisputably immense potential, getting a quantum business to the point where it's efficient and profitable is quite the challenge. None of the prominent quantum companies -- yes, including IonQ -- has yet to stem their often very deep net losses. There are potentially significant catalysts on the horizon. One that could change the landscape dramatically is Congress's National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Act. As the name implies, this would restart a federal program aimed at boosting quantum, with public funding for businesses actively involved in such work. Capital for cash-hungry companies on the cutting-edge of new technologies is almost always scarce; passing the act into law would alleviate that nagging and persistent headache. I have to emphasize here that such industry-boosting factors are only potential at this point, not reality. And that goes double for any talk of a single quantum company or a clutch of them becoming the new Nvidia or Broadcom. Both of these successful enterprises are the products of years of patient business development and often heavy research and development expenditure. Neither blasted into the world suddenly as cash-gushing winners. At this point, it's hard to place bets on which quantum company, or companies, will pull ahead with offerings irresistible to customers thirsty for exponential increases in computing power. Given that, it's probably a good move for quantum bulls to spread out their investments among the leading stocks in the space. I feel all of the aforementioned titles can potentially leverage the technology into robust profits eventually -- and yes, that includes IonQ, all hype and hot air aside. Before you buy stock in Quantum Computing, consider this: The analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now\u2026 and Quantum Computing wasn\u2019t one of them.

On May 21, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers reiterated an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the stock with a $185.00 price target. Rakers noted that Nvidia\u2019s NVLink Technology has growing potential, particularly after the launch of NVLink Fusion. The technology allows third-party custom silicon and CPUs to integrate NVIDIA\u2019s memory-coherent NVLink for chip-to-chip interconnect. While some industry reports do suggest that this CPU connectivity isn\u2019t something novel, Rakers stressed the role of NVLink interconnect in AI infrastructure. NVIDIA\u2019s NVLink interconnect offers significant bandwidth advantages over the standard PCIe. In particular, the NVLink version 6, anticipated to be launched in the second half of 2026, is expected to double the bandwidth to 3.6TB/s with Rubin R200 GPUs. Rakers also highlighted how Nvidia is enhancing its competitive edge through its move to externalize NVLink. It is doing so by enabling its Grace and Vera CPUs to connect with custom accelerators and CPUs.

    "body": "Advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have taken the world by storm over the past few years, but much of the initial hype has since subsided. Investors are looking for evidence that the adoption of AI still has legs. Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs) quickly became the gold standard for training and running models. The company generated five consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue and profit growth, but as its growth rate began to decelerate, investors got nervous. The company is scheduled to release the results of its fiscal 2026 first quarter after the market closes on Wednesday, May 28, and shareholders -- and indeed Wall Street at large -- will be sitting on the edge of their seats for clues as to where AI goes from here. Let's review the company's most recent results, see what the available evidence suggests about the company's future prospects, and whether Nvidia stock is a compelling opportunity ahead of its highly anticipated financial report. Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. Image source: Nvidia. For its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 26), Nvidia reported revenue of $39.3 billion, which soared 78% year over year and 12% sequentially. Strong sales drove robust earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89, which surged 82%. Lest there be any doubt, it was the continuing adoption of AI that fueled the results, as revenue in its data center segment jumped 93%. Nvidia expects its strong growth to continue. For its fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 28), management is guiding for revenue of $43 billion, which would represent growth of 65%. Wall Street is equally bullish, with analysts' consensus estimates calling for revenue of $43.15 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.73. While this would mark a minor deceleration compared to last quarter's robust sales performance, it would be remarkably strong nonetheless. Nvidia has a long history of issuing conservative guidance, so the actual results could well be higher. The popular narrative suggests the rapid buildout of AI-centric data centers by the major cloud and tech companies is showing cracks, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet 's Google Cloud, the \"Big Three\" in cloud computing, have announced plans to boost infrastructure spending this year. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of that spending is earmarked for additional data centers to support demand for AI. Not to be outdone, Meta Platforms has already announced plans for higher capex spending than it originally envisioned. The totals are intriguing: As the world's foremost provider of processors used for AI, Nvidia is well-positioned to capture a significant part of this data center spending from the four horsemen of tech. There's more. The Trump administration recently rescinded the so-called \"AI Diffusion Rule.\" The strict set of export curbs initiated by the Biden Administration was designed to keep U.S. adversaries from using AI against our national interests. Critics complained the rules were strict and threatened to stifle innovation. Rescinding this rule opened the floodgates, resulting in a host of new AI chip deals for Nvidia. For example, the company announced a partnership with Saudi Arabian company Humain. Nvidia will immediately supply more than 18,000 GB300 Grace Blackwell processors -- its most advanced AI chips -- for the country's data center buildout, with plans to eventually ship \"several hundred thousand.\" The deal also includes Infiniband networking technology solutions, which provide ultra-fast processing combined with low latency. This helps illustrate the vast opportunity that remains for Nvidia. Make no mistake, Nvidia remains extremely volatile, but it's hard to deny the company's long-term success. Over the past three years, the stock has gained 688% (as of this writing) but has also fallen as much as 35% -- so it isn't for the faint of heart. This helps illustrate one of the surest paths to investing success: Buy stocks in the best businesses you can find and plan to hold for three to five years. The biggest question on the mind of investors is whether Nvidia stock will rise or fall following its highly anticipated financial report, and the truth is I have no idea. In fact, anyone who professes to know what will happen in the days or weeks to come is not being completely honest. If I were to prognosticate, I would feel comfortable making several very vague predictions: Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine, and my predictions could be dead wrong. That said, nothing about my investing thesis for Nvidia has changed. The company's state-of-the-art GPUs are the gold standard for AI processing, and it continues to dominate the market. There's always the chance someone will create a better mousetrap, so to speak, but the specter of competition is always a factor. The majority of experts believe we're still in the early stages of AI adoption. Most estimates place the AI market size at a minimum of $1 trillion, with some estimates suggesting it could eventually be 10 to 15 times higher. Nvidia stock currently sells for roughly 30 times forward earnings, with its valuation recently rebounding from a two-year low. However, the company's history of innovation, industry-leading position, and long track record of growth give me confidence the best is yet to come. For investors who believe that AI is still in the early innings and Nvidia will continue to lead the charge, buy Nvidia stock and buckle up for the bumpy -- yet potentially lucrative -- ride ahead. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: The analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "Well, all week we had been looking for a market catalyst, with economic prints scarce and Q1 earnings season winding down. We finally got it yesterday, with news that the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d was about to pass the House \u2014 that which would extend the major tax cuts due to expire, among other things. It was what President Trump got elected on, after all, with Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE project designed to cut waste in federal spending. However, this bill is currently projected to add $3.1 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, which has riled credit agencies that wasted little time downgrading U.S. credit from AAA to AA1. This is before the Senate has gotten its hooks into the bill, and we know changes are going to be made. It has also gotten the attention of the bond market, which is now up over +4.6% on the 10-year, +4.0% on the 2-year and above +5.0% on the 30-year. The 20-year bond option yesterday triggered the mid-day sell-off. Major indexes fell from -1.4% (Nasdaq) to -1.9% (Dow) by yesterday\u2019s close. This morning, we sank temporarily but are climbing at this hour: -120 points on the Dow, -5 on the S&P 500 and +15 points on the Nasdaq. The small-cap Russell 2000, which dropped -2.6% yesterday, is down another -10 points currently. Thankfully, this morning we do have economic reports to parse. Among them, like every normal Thursday, we see Initial Jobless Claims remaining in the groove with a healthy labor environment, at 227K \u2014 2000 lower than the unrevised 229K reported for the previous week. Every several weeks or so we tend to see a pop above 240K, but always come back down in the subsequent prints. Continuing Claims came in at 1.903 million \u2014 above the psychological threshold of 1.9 million, but which has been revised down below it in all but one week of 2025 so far. This follows a downwardly revised 1.87 million from the prior week (these longer-term claims are reported a week behind initial claims). With aging workers taking their pink slips as a sign to call it a career, along with ex-federal employees currently living on severance packages, the long-awaited pressure on the labor market has been mild at worst to this point. The parade of retailers reporting quarterly earnings continues this morning, with upscale retailer Ralph Lauren RL outpacing fiscal Q4 earnings estimates by 3 cents to $2.03 per share, on $1.70 billion in quarterly revenues, which surpassed the $1.63 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares are up modestly on the news, adding to the stock\u2019s +18% gains year to date. Down the tax bracket a bit, BJ\u2019s Wholesale BJ put up mixed numbers in its Q1 earnings report this morning. Earnings of $1.14 per share amounted to a nice beat on the bottom line, above the 91 cents analysts were expecting. Revenues, on the other hand, came in -0.5% from expectations to $5.15 billion. But reaffirming forward guidance has kept the stock up +2% this morning, adding to its +31% gains year to date. After the opening bell, we\u2019ll see S&P flash PMI for both Services and Manufacturing for the month of May. While both are expected to tick down a tad, Services is expected to remain above the 50-threshold (between growth and loss) and Manufacturing is anticipated to dip back below it. Existing Home Sales for April are expected to come in somewhat stronger: 4.13 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units versus 4.02 million posted a month ago. We have seen more homes come on line for sale of late, but off a very scarce base overall. New Home Sales, which come out tomorrow, are expected to slide back a bit. Also, earnings continues the final leg of its tour for the quarter, with Workday WDAY, AutoDesk ADSK and Deckers Outdoor DECK coming out with results after today\u2019s close. Calendar Q1 earnings season has not been exactly stellar, but far from the bleak levels many analysts had been expecting \u2014 especially on guidance. Earnings season unofficially ends next week, when NVIDIA NVDA reports. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days."

    "body": "The cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday. Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year. Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41\u00a0on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain. However, it was still hovering around $110,950 and was on track to make further gains. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by a mix of positive news, including easing trade tensions, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and upbeat sentiment among institutional buyers. Bitcoin\u2019s rally followed the U.S. equity market\u2019s slump on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking a massive hit. The reason behind the diverging movement between cryptocurrencies and equities could be that investors are looking for alternative stores of value. Also, trade tensions have eased substantially over the past couple of weeks after the United States and China announced a trade truce and paused tariffs temporarily for 90 days. The United States also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom earlier this month, while the White House said trade talks with several other nations are ongoing. Besides, there have been some encouraging regulatory developments for the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act \u2014 a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins \u2014 passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate recently. Also, President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, have been rallying for a pro-crypto agenda, which has been boosting the broader crypto market. Visa is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain. This expansion of V includes collaboration with prominent merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, marking a pivotal development in the world of digital payments. Visa\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 12.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 90 days. V currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . PayPal Holdings provides digital wallet services that enable users to purchase, transfer, and sell various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Through PYPL, users can use cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services from online merchants. Additionally, PayPal\u2019s mobile wallet platform, Venmo, allows users to engage in cryptocurrency buying and selling activities. PayPal\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 9.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 90 days. PYPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3. NVIDIA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of NVDA\u2019s stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies. NVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 41.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 90 days.

    "body": "Prominent investor Steve Weiss said on May 19 that he would probably sell all of his Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report. The giant chip maker is slated to report its Q1 results on May 28. A frequent guest on CNBC, Weiss is the Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner of Short Hills Capital Partners. Meanwhile, on the same segment, another frequent CNBC guest, Joe Terranova, sounded significantly more bullish on the near-term outlook of NVDA stock. Terranova is the Senior Managing Director of Virtus Investment. Noting that he would be \"uncomfortable\" holding Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) if its reaches its old high of around $150, Weiss suggested that a higher price would not be justified by the chip maker's current fundamentals. Calling his holdings of NVDA \"a decent trading position,\" the investor said he would \"most likely\" unload all of his shares before the company reports its Q1 results. \"I've got enough\u00a0 tech exposure. Why take the risk of holding something I'm not committed to (into its earnings report)?\" Weiss said. The veteran investor pointed out that Abu Dhabi had recently agreed to buy 18,000 of Nvidia's chips for its data center, and he said that \"demand (for NVDA's semiconductor) is coming from other places around the world.\" And according to Terranova, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has been \"speaking with a lot of confidence in the last several days.\" Finally, Terranova reported that large investors have been buying meaningful amounts of the shares of NVDA and other chip makers recently. \"I wouldn't be surprised if after next week (NVDA stock) is higher than it is now,\" he concluded. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

    "body": "Many investors closely watch 13F filings from institutional money managers. While isn\u2019t typically seen in that role, it must file as well, since it manages over $100 million in U.S.-traded securities. Below is a breakdown of the six stocks listed on NVIDIA\u2019s most recent 13F . Examining these holdings provides insight into the types of technology that this pioneering company is betting on. All return data calculates the change in price through the May 21 close, since NVIDIA revealed its initial stake in these companies, including their initial rise. By far, NVIDIA\u2019s largest 13F holding was . CoreWeave . Aside from owning approximately 7% of CoreWeave, the company is also one of NVIDIA\u2019s biggest customers. CoreWeave uses its close relationship with NVIDIA to rent out the company\u2019s most advanced AI chips to customers before anyone else. On its last earnings call, CoreWeave said it was the first to deploy NVIDIA\u2019s GB200 Grace Blackwell systems at scale. Since going public in March, CoreWeave has increased by a staggering 169%, driven largely by the excitement surrounding its . The next two largest NVIDIA 13F holdings are and . They represent around 10% and 4% of NVIDIA\u2019s total $1.15 billion 13F portfolio . NVIDIA actually tried to ; however, the transaction fell through due to regulatory issues. ARM provides \u201cIP cores,\" essentially the basic designs of chips that companies base their advanced chips on. As such, ARM is a very important but somewhat underappreciated player in semiconductors. Applied Digital is somewhat similar to CoreWeave, renting out computing power to customers. However, it still gets a good amount of its revenue from cryptocurrency miners , something that CoreWeave no longer dabbles in. The company is also tiny, comparatively, worth only around $1.5 billion. Since November 2024, when NVIDIA first reported owning Applied Digital , the stock is down approximately 1%. NVIDIA\u2019s fourth largest 13F holding is the clinical-stage drug company, . The company has no medicines approved by regulators yet, and thus doesn\u2019t generate much revenue. Overall, the company\u2019s free cash flow over the last 12 months was around -$400 million. The company is attempting to use AI to accelerate drug discovery and development. Importantly, Recursion is an NVIDIA customer that uses the firm\u2019s chips to power its supercomputer to achieve its mission. It is prioritizing work on four cancer treatments and two rare disease treatments. Even after jumping 24% the day NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February 2024, shares are down 51%. NVIDIA\u2019s final two holdings are and , each making up around 2% of its portfolio. Nebius\u2019s business model is also very similar to CoreWeave\u2019s, which is renting out AI computing power. Like CoreWeave, it is also seeing incredible revenue growth , reporting a 385% increase in sales in Q1. Nebius will be among the first companies that will offer . Despite rising 7% on the day the initial NVIDIA investment came out, investors have seen shares drop nearly 7% overall. Last up is WeRide. The company operates a variety of robotaxis and other autonomous driving vehicle platforms, primarily in China. WeRide uses NVIDIA\u2019s advanced chips to operate its technology. Even including the 83% surge in shares after NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February, they have fallen nearly 40% overall since then as of May 21. There is one clear common thread among all these companies in which NVIDIA is investing : they are either customers or suppliers of NVIDIA. This makes sense considering that NVIDIA would deeply understand their businesses. Overall, having investments from NVIDIA doesn't mean investors should blindly follow behind the tech giant and invest in these stocks. This is especially true as merely associating with NVIDIA can often drive wild up moves in these names, only to see their shares crater back to earth. Still, NVIDIA's investment is a positive, and directing a watchful eye toward these names makes sense. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

    "body": "In today\u2019s market, it\u2019s difficult to identify a good value opportunity considering that the broader S&P 500 index is trading near its all-time highs now. However, this is where keeping track of what the so-called \u201csmart money \u201d is buying or selling can be useful. Seeing what the bigger players in the market are doing can spark new ideas for investors to consider if they can successfully reverse-engineer the thinking or the thesis behind these moves by institutional investors. This means making it part of their portfolio and understanding what might drive performance and risk. By insourcing an idea into an individual process, investors can better understand what may drive profits and what may bring on losses instead of relying on someone else\u2019s homework. Today\u2019s homework can be taken from Cathie Wood , as she recently decided to buy up a significant stake in shares of , and there must be a good reason for that. Before investors understand why Cathie Wood\u2019s fund decided to buy up a position in Taiwan Semiconductor , they need to understand the company\u2019s role in today\u2019s market developments. With the recent volatility around the caused by President Trump's trade tariffs , a few things must be considered. Some businesses have delayed new orders for equipment and products coming out of China, which will likely slow down the demand for chips and semiconductors, essential in a large share of imports today. However, an agreement has been reached between the United States and China, pushing for a 90-day pause on tariffs centered on clearing the way for semiconductors as a priority . This might get things moving in the right direction for a major company like Taiwan Semiconductor, relieving some of the uncertainty and pressures off future financials. However, another factor to consider here is that this company is essential in most (if not all) of the chip supply chain. Most investors would focus on a name like as one of the most popular ones in this group, given that it has attracted the most price action over the recent months and years. However, some would fail to realize that there wouldn\u2019t be any NVIDIA without the technology and equipment that Taiwan Semiconductor makes. That\u2019s not only true for NVIDIA; plenty of other names in the consumer electronics space indirectly rely on Taiwan Semiconductor in this manner. That being said, Cathie Wood and her team may have considered this positioning when opening their new position. As tariff uncertainty will likely subside in the coming months and quarters, investors can safely assume that Taiwan Semiconductor will start to see the same level of new orders and bookings as it typically does under a typical environment. Seeing the stock trade at 85% of its 52-week high , and delivering a monthly rally of up to 29.6%, the consensus might be pricing in a few better quarters down the road, justifying the decision to buy in recent days, but the . Short sellers now realize that Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s risk-to-reward ratio looks a bit too focused on the upside, especially with room to flirt again with new 52-week highs. For this reason, and given the industry's fundamental setup today, investors can see that up to 15.5% of the company\u2019s short interest declined over the past month alone. Witnessing the bears leave in a sign of capitulation, today\u2019s buyers of Taiwan Semiconductor stock might still see a more straightforward\u00a0path ahead for higher prices . When scanning for more recent institutional buying, investors can start to conclude that it undeniably helps a bull case in the stock . As of May 2025, those from AllianceBernstein also built up a stake after a recent boost of 31.5%, signaling further institutional confidence that runs deeper than just Cathie Wood\u2019s fund. This is another big pillar of strength for new investors still on the fence to consider. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

    "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a game-changing technology, where the right stocks could earn investors handsome gains. But as with any technology that comes along, investors will need to watch for companies that fail to live up to the hype. This is where following the stock picks of billionaire investors could prove very helpful. These investors have had successful investing careers, and they generally don't invest in a company until they have completed exhaustive research into its competitive position, risks, and return prospects. Fortunately, billionaire fund managers are required to report their holdings on every quarter. The latest round of 13Fs revealed prominent billionaires still buying shares of two high-flying chip stocks in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the leading chip manufacturer in the world. It controls more than 60% of the global foundry market, as it makes chips for leading chip companies, including Nvidia . Growing demand for chips used for in data centers has helped send the stock up 279% over the past five years, and its run may not be over. Three notable billionaires were buying shares in the first quarter. David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital, and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management were adding to their firm's stakes. The company's strong first quarter amid uncertainty over the economy is pointing to tremendous momentum in the AI market. Demand for AI chips remained robust in the first quarter. Revenue and grew 35% and 60% year over year, and TSMC is making significant investments in expanding capacity to support long-term demand. TSMC recently unveiled its A14 logic process technology, representing a step forward from its current 2-nanometer (N2) process. The A14 delivers a 15% increase in performance with a 30% power savings over the N2 and is scheduled to enter production in 2028. These billionaires are making a bet that TSMC is benefiting from sustainable demand in the AI market. They are obviously aware of the 's historical cyclicality, and some of that cyclical nature revealed itself last quarter, as not all the markets that TSMC sells into are experiencing strong demand right now. For example, seasonal softness in smartphone demand caused TSMC's revenue to fall 5% over the previous quarter. It also experienced a small setback in chip production following a recent earthquake that disrupted operations. Over the long term, the increasing use of more technologically advanced devices and data centers for AI should create opportunity for TSMC. The growing need for more advanced chips is why the stock has delivered market-beating returns over the last decade, and it could repeat that performance. TSMC forecasts AI chip sales to double in 2025 and grow at an annualized rate of 40% through 2028. Considering this forecast, the stock looks compelling, trading at a reasonable 21 times this year's earnings estimate, while analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 21%. Image source: Nvidia. TSMC's long-term outlook for AI chip sales bodes well for Nvidia. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in the AI chip market. The stock has rocketed 1,400% over the past five years, yet a few billionaires still see upsides. In the first quarter, Chase Coleman added to his firm's stake, while Daniel Loeb of Third Point established a new position in the stock. Nvidia is coming off an incredible year, where its revenue more than doubled to $130 billion. Based on a strong outlook for Nvidia's new chips going into production, analysts expect the company's revenue to increase by 53% to nearly $200 billion in the current fiscal year. Its new Blackwell computing platform designed for the most advanced AI workloads is already raking in billions in revenue, and the company is racing to raise supply to meet demand. Even Nvidia's automotive chips for self-driving cars are seeing strong demand, with revenue expected to triple this year to $5 billion. One risk for Nvidia is companies pursuing cheaper alternatives than buying its GPUs. Some of Nvidia's customers, including Amazon and Alphabet 's Google, have invested in their own chips for AI. Custom chip solutions can perform more efficiently at specific computing tasks and save money over Nvidia's general-purpose GPUs that can cost tens of thousands of dollars per unit. Coleman and Loeb are obviously betting that data centers will continue to need Nvidia's GPUs. With Nvidia's software, companies can tailor these GPUs to work with a number of use cases. Nvidia just made a flurry of announcements at the recent Computex conference that show its GPU technology becoming more entrenched in companies' AI investment plans. For example, Nvidia and Microsoft are working together on agentic AI, an advanced form of AI that can make decisions without a human prompt. Perhaps the most important announcement from Nvidia was the introduction of NVLink Fusion, which will allow customers to integrate chips from other chipmakers alongside Nvidia's GPUs in data centers. This strategy could ultimately expand the addressable market for Nvidia's chips, while protecting its lead in the AI market. Despite these positive developments, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30, which seems on the low side for a company that analysts expect to grow earnings at a 35% annualized rate. Given , the stock could hit new highs this year and still deliver market-beating returns over the next few years.

    "body": "The month of May has been packed with pivotal data releases. We've had no shortage of earnings reports from influential businesses, a Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, and countless updates on tariff and trade policy from President Donald Trump and his administration. But amid this sea of data, perhaps nothing has been more telling than the filing of with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to file a 13F with the SEC. This filing allows professional and everyday investors to see which stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Wall Street's leading asset managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter. May 15 marked the filing deadline for 13Fs detailing trading activity for the March-ended quarter. Image source: Getty Images. Though , he's far from the only billionaire fund manager known for outsized investment returns. Third Point's billionaire chief Dan Loeb also has quite the following on Wall Street. Loeb closed out the first frame of 2025 with $6.55 billion in AUM which was spread across 45 stocks. But what's particularly noteworthy about Loeb's investing style is his penchant for buying and selling high-growth and widely owned companies. Based on Third Point's latest 13F, Dan Loeb completely kicked North America's kingpin Tesla to the curb and chose to pile into Wall Street's preeminent artificial intelligence (AI) stock. Although Dan Loeb completely exited nine positions at Third Point during the first quarter, including social media colossus Meta Platforms , the sale of 500,000 shares of Tesla is what stands out most. The reason? and tacked on an additional 100,000 shares in the December-ended quarter. Between Jan. 1 and March 31, something changed. This \"something\" could very well be Tesla's soaring share price. In the wake of President Donald Trump's victory in November and CEO Elon Musk being designated as a \"special government employee\" for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Tesla stock very briefly doubled. The average stock in Loeb's portfolio has an average hold time of a little over 13 months, so he's not shy about locking in profits. But . To begin with, there's growing concern that Musk's involvement with DOGE and his numerous other companies and projects are detracting from Tesla's growth potential. Despite continued sales growth from Tesla's energy generation and storage operations, EV revenue plunged 20% in the first quarter from the prior-year period. Moreover, Tesla's vehicle margin has been trending lower for the last two years. Musk noted during his company's 2023 annual meeting that . A slew of sweeping price cuts for Tesla's fleet (Model's 3, S, X, and Y) confirms that competition is picking up and/or demand for EVs has waned. Even with steep price cuts, Tesla has struggled to keep its EV inventory levels from rising. Another concern is that . Companies with first-mover advantages should be generating their profits from their products and services. More than half of Tesla's pre-tax income can be traced to automotive regulatory credits, which are given to it for free by governments, and interest income earned on its cash. Without automotive regulatory credits, Tesla would have reported a pre-tax loss in the March-ended quarter. Lastly, Dan Loeb might be out due to . For instance, Tesla's chief has claimed that Level 5 full self-driving is \"one year away\" for the last 11 years. He also expected 1 million robotaxis on American roadways \"next year\" in 2019. The cherry on top is that demand for Cybertruck has been well below the initial hype. If these unfulfilled promises are backed out of Tesla's valuation, its stock could have a long way to fall. Image source: Getty Images. On the other end of the spectrum, Third Point's 13F shows that Loeb opened 10 new positions during the first quarter. Though he did add a handful of high-yield dividend stocks, such as telecom titan AT&T and consumer health products company Kenvue , which isn't unexpected given the volatility we began witnessing in the stock market late in the first quarter, Loeb's eyebrow-raising purchase is premier AI stock Nvidia . The last time Third Point's billionaire investor held shares of Nvidia for his fund was the second quarter of 2023. He then sold what's now the equivalent of 5,000,000 shares of Nvidia during the third quarter of 2023, which . During the first quarter of 2025, Loeb scooped up 1,450,000 shares, which are currently valued at almost $196 million. No company has been a more direct beneficiary of the AI revolution than Nvidia. Its Hopper graphics processing units (GPUs) and Blackwell GPU architecture are the . Essentially, Nvidia's hardware is the brains behind generative AI solutions and the training of many large language models (LLMs). Nvidia has also been able to take full advantage of AI-GPU scarcity. Even with world-leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Nvidia can't come close to meeting the full demand for its hardware. When demand for a good overwhelms supply, it's perfectly normal the price of that good to climb. Both Nvidia's Hopper and Blackwell GPUs are commanding a premium to competing chips, which has been a benefit to the company's gross margin. Even the CUDA software platform is doing its part to make Nvidia one of Wall Street's most-influential businesses. CUDA is the toolkit developers use to maximize the compute potential of their Nvidia GPUs, as well as build LLMs. More importantly, it's an anchoring tool that's helping to keep clients loyal to Nvidia's ecosystem of products and services. The final piece of the puzzle for Loeb looks to be Nvidia's valuation, which has become considerably more palatable. During the tail-end of March, Nvidia's dipped to around 19, which appears quite inexpensive given the growth rate it's been able to sustain. But Nvidia stock isn't guaranteed to head higher. Every next-big-thing trend for more than three decades . The simple fact that most businesses lack a well-defined AI game plan and aren't generating a profit on their AI investments signals that investors have, once again, overestimated the adoption rate and utility of another game-changing technology. Competition is a genuine concern, as well. As both , AI-GPU scarcity will diminish. Ultimately, this is bad news for Nvidia's AI-GPU pricing power and its margins.

    "body": "With the stock market having calmed down and settled into a more normal trading pattern, now might be a good time to start investing in some great tech stocks. $1,000 is a great starting point to begin accumulating shares, and then if the market dips again, you have room to add more. Let's look at two terrific tech stocks to start buying now with a $1,000 investment. Image source: Getty Images. Chip giant Nvidia remains the best-positioned company to continue to benefit from the buildout. Its have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, providing the computing power needed to run AI workloads. The company's dominance in the GPU space can be seen in its over 80% market share. While the company's chips are top-notch, what has really set it apart and created a wide moat is its CUDA software platform. It created the free software platform to allow developers to be able to program its chips for purposes beyond their original intent of helping speed up graphics rendering in video games. Since then, it has built a collection of libraries and tools on top of its platform called CUDA X that helps bolster the performance of its chips for AI tasks. The company sees demand for its GPUs coming from multiple areas. The biggest is in the space, where the big three providers are aggressively building out data centers to keep up with the demand stemming from customers looking to customize AI models and run AI workloads on their systems. In addition, companies that build foundation AI models, such as Meta Platforms and xAI, have also been building out data centers, while OpenAI is part of the Stargate Project, a consortium that plans to spend $500 billion on data centers over the next few years. Enterprises have also started to increase their on-premise data center spending as they look to deploy hybrid cloud models for AI. At the same time, countries have also begun to invest in AI infrastructure. For example, on his trip to the Middle East, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a big AI infrastructure investment from Saudi Arabia. When looking at risks, the biggest one Nvidia faces is if AI infrastructure spending begins to slow. The company does not have a recurring revenue stream like a software company, so it relies on increased demand for its chips. Right now, though, it appears that AI infrastructure spending is poised to continue to ramp up. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, with a of under 31 times this year's analyst estimates and a 0.6 , with numbers below 1 considered undervalued. One tech stock that has been tossed in the bargain bin this year is Alphabet . While the company has continued to post strong revenue and earnings growth, investors remain concerned that AI is going to disrupt its main search business. Alphabet's Google search engine has a dominant position in search, with an approximate 90% global market share. However, there is no doubt that AI chatbots are gaining momentum and beginning to become more mainstream. While they have their flaws, there are many things that these AI chatbots do well, and they can answer more complex questions better than a search. But Google Search doesn't make much money from searches involving things like helping students with a biology paper or helping someone design a workout routine. Historically, it has only served ads on about 20% of its queries and makes money from searches with a commercial intent. As such, when the company recently introduced its new AI Mode for search, it came with clear ways to improve upon inquiries with commercial intent. This included agentic capabilities, where it can search across platforms to present you with the best ticket prices from sites like Ticketmaster and StubHub for a concert or sporting event. Need to research a summer camp for your child with specific criteria and distance from your home? It can do that. It also has a Shop by AI Mode that can find items based on your description, let you try on outfits virtually using an uploaded photo of yourself, and even track prices for items you are interested in. In addition to its often-overlooked strength in AI, Alphabet has some big advantages that tend to get ignored. Between its Android smartphone operating system, Chrome browser, and revenue-sharing deal with Apple to be the exclusive search engine for Safari, the company is the default search engine on most devices connected to the internet. It also has the world's largest advertising network, and its reach in local markets around the globe is difficult to replicate. As such, in what is ultimately a two-sided marketplace of consumers and advertisers, Google has been able to entrench itself on both sides. So, despite the inroads that Perplexity and ChatGPT have made, Google still has a solid moat. With a forward P/E of only 17.5 times, Alphabet stock is cheap. Investors also get a lot more than Alphabet's search business. They get its fast-growing cloud computing business, a rapidly expanding robotaxi business in , and the most watched video streaming service in the world with YouTube.

    "body": "Yesterday, Navitas Semiconductor stock exploded by more than 160% following news that Nvidia has selected the company to help develop 800-volt, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power systems for its next-generation (AI) data centers. With roughly 12.8% of Navitas shares sold short before the announcement and a market cap still hovering around $886 million as of this writing, this explosive move has triggered a mix of excitement and skepticism among investors. Image source: Getty Images. The question now is whether this rally has staying power -- or whether investors have already missed the moment. The answer may depend on understanding not just what happened, but why it matters for the future of AI infrastructure. Read on to find out more. The Nvidia partnership isn't window dressing -- it positions Navitas at the center of one of the most ambitious infrastructure overhauls in AI history. The collaboration involves replacing today's antiquated 54V power architecture with a revolutionary 800V HVDC standard capable of supporting IT racks of 1 megawatt or more. To put this in perspective, current data center infrastructure maxes out at a few hundred kilowatts per rack. Nvidia's next-generation \"Kyber\" rack-scale systems, powering graphics processing units (GPUs) like the upcoming Rubin Ultra, will demand unprecedented power density. The shift to 800V HVDC isn't just an upgrade -- it's a complete rethinking of how power flows through the digital backbone of AI. Why does this matter? Because power delivery is quickly becoming the bottleneck for AI expansion. As compute requirements explode, traditional power systems are hitting physical limits. Nvidia's projections suggest the shift to HVDC could improve data center power efficiency by 5%, cut copper use by 45%, and reduce maintenance costs by up to 70%. For hyperscale operators managing thousands of racks, these improvements translate to millions in operational savings. Navitas' gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors are central to delivering this transformation. Its GaNFast and GeneSiC technologies enable the high-frequency switching and thermal efficiency required for 800V systems -- capabilities that traditional silicon simply cannot match. What sets Navitas apart isn't just its technology -- it's the company's integrated approach. While competitors focus on individual components, Navitas has developed complete power system solutions. Their recent demonstration of an 8.5 kW AI data center power supply achieving 98% efficiency isn't just impressive -- it's production-ready. The company's GaNSafe power ICs (integrated circuits) include integrated protection features that traditional discrete solutions lack. Meanwhile, its GeneSiC silicon carbide devices utilize proprietary \"trench-assisted planar\" technology that delivers superior performance and reliability. The magnitude of the stock's move wasn't driven by fundamentals alone. As of the latest report, 12.8% of Navitas' float was sold short -- an unusually high level for a small-cap tech name. This situation created a powder keg waiting for a catalyst. can be violent and brief, and the rally from under $2 to nearly $5 in a single session reflects a technical unwind as much as a fundamental repricing. The high short interest suggests many investors had written off Navitas as another struggling semiconductor company. The Nvidia announcement forced a rapid reassessment. But here's what makes this different from typical short squeezes: The underlying catalyst has substance. This isn't a meme stock rally driven by social media hype -- it's a fundamental shift in how one of the world's most important technology companies approaches power infrastructure. Despite the excitement, Navitas' financials still demand caution. The company generated approximately $83 million in revenue in 2024 but posted a net loss of nearly the same amount. The bottom line is that the path to consistent profitability remains unclear without significant design wins and volume ramps. That's not surprising given the large short interest, and this Nvidia news doesn't immediately change the situation. Navitas remains a speculative stock, but the asymmetric upside has sharpened considerably. The Nvidia partnership validates both the technology and market opportunity while providing a credible path to scale revenue. A market cap under $900 million leaves substantial room for revaluation if the collaboration leads to broader industry adoption. What's the investing takeaway? Navitas has suddenly moved from obscurity to center stage in the next phase of the AI infrastructure build. The stock may give back some of its recent gains as momentum fades, but the company's opportunity has suddenly expanded in a way that's impossible to ignore. That said, this small-cap tech stock should still be viewed as a high-risk, high-reward option on the larger AI infrastructure build.

    "body": "The FlexShares US Quality Large Cap ETF (QLC) made its debut on 09/23/2015, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend category of the market. For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment. Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way. However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta. Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance. Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns. Because the fund has amassed over $460.30 million, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Blend. QLC is managed by Flexshares. QLC, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust Quality Large Cap Index. The Northern Trust Quality Large Cap Index is designed to measure the performance of a universe of large capitalization securities which demonstrate characteristics of better quality, attractive valuation and positive momentum. Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same. Annual operating expenses for QLC are 0.25%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space. The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.01%. While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 32.70% of the portfolio. Financials and Telecom round out the top three. Taking into account individual holdings, Apple Inc Common Stock Usd 0.00001 (AAPL) accounts for about 6.75% of the fund's total assets, followed by Nvidia Corp Common Stock Usd 0.001 (NVDA) and Microsoft Corp Common Stock Usd 0.00000625 (MSFT). Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 34.52% of QLC's total assets under management. The ETF has added roughly 0.92% so far this year and is up about 13.19% in the last one year (as of 05/23/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $56.84 and $69.86. The fund has a beta of 0.99 and standard deviation of 17.68% for the trailing three-year period, which makes QLC a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 166 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. FlexShares US Quality Large Cap ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well. SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) tracks S&P 500 Index and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) tracks S&P 500 Index.

This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics. Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns. Because the fund has amassed over $1.66 billion, this makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Blend. TILT is managed by Flexshares. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar U.S. Market Factor Tilt Index. The Morningstar U.S. Market Factor Tilt Index measures the performance of U.S. equity markets with increased exposure toward small-capitalization and value stocks. Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same. With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.25%. The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.26%. Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. For TILT, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 24.20% of the portfolio --while Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three. When you look at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp Common Stock Usd 0.00000625 (MSFT) accounts for about 4.47% of the fund's total assets, followed by Apple Inc Common Stock Usd 0.00001 (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp Common Stock Usd 0.001 (NVDA). The top 10 holdings account for about 23.05% of total assets under management. The ETF has lost about -1.60% and is up about 8.40% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 05/23/2025), respectively. TILT has traded between $181.13 and $227.39 during this last 52-week period. The ETF has a beta of 1.04 and standard deviation of 18.30% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 1954 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. FlexShares Morningstar U.S. Market Factor Tilt ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider. IShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT) tracks S&P Total Market Index and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) tracks CRSP US Total Market Index. IShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF has $66.79 billion in assets, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF has $467.57 billion. ITOT has an expense ratio of 0.03% and VTI charges 0.03%.

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.05%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.22%.

    "body": "On May 18, 2025, announced the latest updates and systems in its efforts to spur the . These tools, including new models for humanoid reasoning, motion, and skills, may contribute to what CEO Jensen Huang has described as the \" next industrial revolution ,\" made possible with physical AI and robotics. As is often the case when NVIDIA makes moves in the direction of a particular technology, investors have turned their attention in response to a number of other firms working in the area of robotics . While NVIDIA is one of a number of involved in the development of hardware or software necessary for the advancement of robotics, investors keen on the potential for this technology can also turn to smaller, dedicated companies that may have stellar growth potential. Two names in particular, and , might be worth considering for those bullish on robotics as a field. Serve Robotics is known for its self-driving delivery robots, which provide food delivery services throughout the United States. Through a partnership with which it spun off from in 2021, Serve achieves a key advantage over other delivery services in its ability to complete the so-called \"last-mile\" challenge . It's easy to imagine Serve's purview, which includes a host of other delivery and logistics tasks. Serve is undergoing a tremendous scale-up , so it's understandable that losses have been mounting. In the latest quarter, the company deployed 250 of its newest generation of robots and aims to have a fleet of 2,000 by the end of 2025. So far this year, Serve has increased its daily supply hours by 40% over the final quarter of 2024, boosting delivery volume by more than 75% from the first week of the latest quarter to the last. It has also more than doubled its household reach since December while dramatically increasing its merchant partnerships. Revenue remains low at $440,000 for the latest quarter, though this marks a 150% sequential improvement on a quarterly basis. Serve also expects second-quarter revenue to grow sequentially at a 35% to 60% pace. Overall, Serve is rapidly expanding and building a desirable niche in a new segment of a popular industry. Investors may hesitate at the significant discrepancy between the company's revenue and its net losses, but the firm did end the first quarter with a record $198 million in cash on hand. This should provide it ample room to continue to build out its operations. It's no surprise, then, that have given them a Buy rating . The stock also has a consensus price target of $19.50 , nearly double the current price levels. Richtech Robotics creates robots to automate the service industry, including for delivery, cleaning, and other applications. Its products are designed for use in retail spaces, restaurants, hotels, casinos, medical facilities, and more. Richtech has recently begun to shift from robot sales to a new robots-as-a-service (RaaS) model, expanding its addressable market to a size of roughly $230 billion . The company achieved 400 customer installations as of the latest quarter and aims to increase that figure by 150% by 2026. The growing labor shortage in the service market provides a gap that Richtech seeks to fill with its robots and robot services. The company sees its robots being usable for up to 80% of jobs across the service industry. For the trailing four-quarter period through the end of March of this year, Richtech reported $4.4 million in revenue and $6.5 million in secured RaaS contracts, as well as nearly $32 million in cash reserves on hand. However, the latest earnings report was lackluster, as the company missed earnings forecasts and recorded its widest-ever net losses. The company also faces dilution due to warrant exercises. Combined, these make Richtech a riskier investment than Serve. Still, the firm has garnered Buy ratings from both analysts reviewing its stock, as well as upside potential of about 39%. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this. MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

    "body": "Nvidia was unstoppable last year, when it added over $2 trillion to its market cap. Along the way, it split its stock for the second time this decade and the sixth time overall since going public in 1999. Companies often outperform the market after splitting their stock, and that was the case for Nvidia after its most recent stock split. But the tech giant has slowed down quite a bit in 2025. It has been volatile, like many major tech stocks, and its share price is down 3% year-to-date at the time of this writing. Is another stock split in the cards to boost Nvidia's share price? Here's what to expect and a look at Nvidia's recent results. Image source: Getty Images. I won't keep you in suspense -- I highly doubt Nvidia will split its stock in 2025 or 2026. The primary benefit of a is that it lowers a company's share price, which makes investing in that company seem more affordable. \"Seem\" is the operative word here. The number of outstanding shares increases, but the company's overall value doesn't. If a company is trading for $1,000 or $2,000, some investors will likely think twice about investing because of how much it costs to buy in. It's not a huge barrier, now that many brokers let investors buy , but a lower share price can help increase the appeal of a stock. After Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split on June 10, 2024, it went from a share price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. For new investors, especially those on a budget, it's much easier to buy a stock for $120 than for $1,200. Nvidia's value has gone up by 10.2% since its stock split. Since the share price has only changed a relatively small amount, another stock split doesn't serve much of a purpose. has been one of the biggest winners as tech companies have increased spending on artificial intelligence (AI). Revenue has grown for eight consecutive quarters, and by a sizable amount -- it reported $130.5 billion in revenue for its 2025 fiscal year, up 114% year over year. About 88% of that revenue comes from data centers and the graphics processing units (GPUs) that Nvidia develops for them. While data centers now make up a dominant portion of Nvidia's business, it's also a leader in gaming GPUs and reported $11.4 billion in revenue from that segment during its 2025 fiscal year. In addition to its revenue growth, Nvidia is a highly profitable company. for the 2025 fiscal year was an impressive 75%, and its net income of $72.9 billion was a 145% year-over-year increase. Nvidia has its next quarterly earnings report on May 28, and it has consistently surpassed analysts' expectations in recent years. There may not be a stock split on the horizon, but a positive earnings report is even better. Most importantly, Nvidia is doing well financially because of the strength of its business. Demand for GPUs has skyrocketed since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia is the leading GPU company, including gaming GPUs and the most advanced AI GPUs. The global GPU market is projected to keep growing, with Arizton Advisory & Intelligence estimating it will go from $70 billion in 2024 to $237.5 billion in 2030. Given Nvidia's dominant position, it will almost certainly take a large slice of the market's growth. The biggest challenge Nvidia is currently facing is the effect of tariffs and a potential U.S.-China trade war. It already reported that it will take a special charge of about $5.5 billion this quarter for exporting H20 processors to China and other locations. And Nvidia manufactures its products in countries that were hit with high tariff rates, although they've been lowered for the time being. In response to the tariff announcement, Nvidia announced plans to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. within the next four years. These plants will produce Nvidia AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. Tariffs could be a headwind in the short term, but Nvidia should be able to navigate them, and there's always the possibility of a trade deal. Stock splits may get investor attention, but a company's financial results and long-term growth prospects are what really matter. Those are two areas where Nvidia shines. I wouldn't expect a repeat of its 2024 results, but I think it's one of the better and will continue to outperform the market. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: The analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 23, 2025 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Tutor Perini Corp. TPC as the Bull of the Day and YETI Holdings, Inc. YETI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA . Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Tutor Perini Corp. just beat and raised 2025 earnings guidance as its construction backlog hit a record high. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) expects earnings in 2026 and 2027 to more than double 2025 earnings. Tutor Perini is a civil, building and specialty construction company offering general contracting and design-build services to private customers and public agencies worldwide. It has expertise on large, complex projects. Tutor Perini often self-performs multiple project components including earthwork, excavation, concrete forming and placement, steel erection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditions as well as fire protection. It's a small cap company with a market cap of $1.88 billion. On May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini reported its first quarter 2025 earnings and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 783%. It reported earnings of $0.53 compared to the Zacks Consensus of just $0.06. It was the company's second best first quarter EPS ever. Tutor Perini has beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Revenue was up 19% to $1.25 billion from $1.05 billion in the year ago period. Growth was solid across all three segments but was primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain newer, higher-margin projects. These projects have significant scope of work remaining. During the first quarter, the company voluntarily repaid the remaining $121.9 million outstanding balance of the Term Loan B, which contributed to a 24% reduction in the company's total debt as compared to the total debt at the end of 2024. Tutor Perini expects solid operating cash flow for the rest of 2025. The business keeps rolling in. In the first quarter, Tutor Perini booked another $2 billion in new awards and contract adjustments, bringing the company's new backlog to a record of $19.4 billion as of March 31, 2025. That is up 94% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2024. Included in those new awards and contracts was the $1.18 billion Manhattan Tunnel project in New York; a $100 million electrical project in Texas; $241 million in additional funding for the Apra Harbor Waterfront Repairs project in Guam; and $111 million of additional funding for certain healthcare facility projects in California. Additionally, the backlog is expected to remain robust as it has already won more than $500 million in new awards in the second quarter of 2025. But it is not resting on these laurels. Other big projects are available. In the Civil segment, Tutor Perini recently bid the multi-billion-dollar Midtown Bus Terminal Replacement project in New York and was awaiting contractor selection by the owner. Many investors are worried about the impact of the 2025 tariffs. As of May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini did not expect to see any significant impact from the tariffs or the curtailment of federal funding. But they will take that quarter by quarter. With a record backlog and opportunities to add to it further, it's not a surprise that Tutor Perini is bullish about 2025. It raised full year earnings guidance to a range of $1.60 to $1.95 from its prior guidance of $1.50 to $1.90. Tutor Perini is lightly followed on the Street, but one analyst did raise their earnings estimates for both 2025 and 2026 after the earnings report. The Zacks Consensus jumped to $1.84 from $1.53 prior to the report. That is earnings growth of 158.8% as the company lost $3.13 last year. 2026 is also looking bullish as the company said they expect earnings to more than double that of 2025 in 2026 and 2027. 1 estimate was raised for 2026 in the last 30 days as well, pushing up 2026 to $2.87. That is further earnings growth of 56%. Here's what it looks like on the 5-year price and consensus chart. Tutor Perini is a small cap company. The small caps have struggled in 2025 but not Tutor Perini. Shares soared to new 5-year highs on the earnings beat and guidance raise and are outperforming the Russell 2000 small cap index year-to-date. Yet, the company is still attractively priced. Tutor Perini trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 19.3. But it has even cheaper value metrics with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.4 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.6. A P/S ratio under 1.0 and a P/B ratio under 3.0 usually indicate value. With a record backlog, Tutor Perini is a small cap stock to keep on your short list. YETI Holdings, Inc. cut guidance in May 2025 due to the impact of the tariffs. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is now expected to see a double-digit decline in earnings this year. YETI is a designer, retailer and distributor of outdoor products worldwide. This includes coolers, drinkware, backpacks and bags. On May 8, 2025, YETI reported its first quarter 2025 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus by $0.04. Earnings were $0.31 compared to the consensus of $0.27. This was the 5 earnings beat in a row. Net sales rose 3% to $351.1 million from $341.4 million a year ago. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 4% to $196.2 million primarily due to growth in Coolers & Equipment. While Wholesale channel sales rose just 1% to $154.9 million, also due to growth in Coolers & Equipment. However, the first quarter seems like a different world as Liberation Day tariffs changed the business in April. YETI already had a plan for supply chain diversification, which is ahead of plan. It is aggressively diversifying its sourcing out of China. It expects, by the end of 2025, to have limited exposure to future goods sourced from China. Less than 5% of its total costs of goods will be related to products from China, for the U.S. market. YETI's ability to generate cash is expected to be intact, even with the disruption from the tariff impacts. But while it is mitigating the tariffs, sales and earnings are still expected to be impacted. For 2025, adjusted sales are expected to increase between 1% and 4%, down from its prior projection of 5% to 7%. Earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.02, down from the prior projection of $2.90 to $2.95. Not surprisingly, the analysts had to cut their estimates to get in line with the new guidance. 10 estimates were cut in the last 30 days for 2025. The Zacks Consensus fell to $2.04 from $2.88. That's down 25.3% from 2024, when YETI made $2.73. 10 estimates were also cut for 2026. You can see the results on the price and consensus chart. YETI was a pandemic winner as people headed outdoors. But since 2022, it's been tougher. Shares are down double digits over the last year. It's cheap. It trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. A P/E under 15 usually indicates value. YETI has a strong balance sheet. It had cash of $259 million as of the end of the first quarter and total debt of $77 million. However, it lowered its 2025 free cash flow guidance to a range of $100 to $125 million from $200 million due to the impact from supply chain disruptions as well as higher tariff cost. Investors interested in YETI might want to wait for more certainty on the tariff fall-out before jumping in. The cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday. Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year. Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. , PayPal Holdings and NVIDIA Corp. . Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain. However, it was still hovering around $110,950 and was on track to make further gains. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by a mix of positive news, including easing trade tensions, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and upbeat sentiment among institutional buyers. Bitcoin's rally followed the U.S. equity market's slump on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking a massive hit. The reason behind the diverging movement between cryptocurrencies and equities could be that investors are looking for alternative stores of value. Also, trade tensions have eased substantially over the past couple of weeks after the United States and China announced a trade truce and paused tariffs temporarily for 90 days. The United States also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom earlier this month, while the White House said trade talks with several other nations are ongoing. Besides, there have been some encouraging regulatory developments for the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act \u2014 a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins \u2014 passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate recently. Also, President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, have been rallying for a pro-crypto agenda, which has been boosting the broader crypto market. Visa Visa Inc. is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain. This expansion of V includes collaboration with prominent merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, marking a pivotal development in the world of digital payments. Visa's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 12.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 90 days. V currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 90 days. PYPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3. NVIDIA NVIDIA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of NVDA's stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies. NVIDIA's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 41.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 90 days.

    "title": "Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?",
    "url": "https://finviz.com/news/65096/micron-stock-soars-23-in-a-month-time-to-hold-or-book-profits",

    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "published_date": "2025-05-23T08:55:00",
    "body": "Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period. This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock? Micron\u2019s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce. The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply. Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively. Micron\u2019s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment. Micron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth. As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron\u2019s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing. The company\u2019s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space. Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain. Additionally, Micron\u2019s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets. Micron\u2019s financial outlook remains robust. The company\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026. Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%. Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector\u2019s 6.07X. The stock\u2019s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively. While Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho. More concerning is the company\u2019s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist. Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron\u2019s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained. Micron\u2019s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term. Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now. Currently, MU carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

    "body": "NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ: ) prospects amid a tariff and export control burdened business environment have received a boost. On May 20, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) CEO Elon Musk confirmed plans to build a 1 million GPU facility outside Memphis. In addition, the executive confirmed plans to buy more chips from the semiconductor giant. The confirmation is a significant boost for Nvidia, which has come under pressure in the aftermath of the US restricting it from selling advanced AI chips to customers in China. While Musk\u2019s artificial Intelligence company xAI has only installed 200,000 GPUs at the colossus facility in Memphis, there is room for an additional 800,000 GPUs, of which Nvidia and other companies can supply Musk also confirmed plans to build a second location featuring one million Nvidia Blackwell GPUs. With the facility expected to be complete in the next six to nine months, it should translate to significant business for Nvidia, which has seen its supply chain under pressure in China amid the Tariff war. Amid the significant order from xAI, analysts at Morgan Stanley have reiterated an Overweight rating on Nvidia stock with a $160 price target.

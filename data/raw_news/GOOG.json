    "body": "With many stocks having now recovered most of the losses sparked by April's \"Liberation Day\" crash, there aren't a lot of bargain stocks to be found. However, a look at the biggest companies on the market or running a stock screener will turn up one stock that looks undervalued: Alphabet . The search giant currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio ( ) of just 18.5, which is close to a 30% discount from the S&P 500 's P/E of 25.9. That discount comes as Alphabet's growth remains solid. In its first-quarter earnings report, revenue rose 12% to $90.2 billion, with operating income jumping 20% to $30.6 billion. However, there's more to investing than the most recent quarter's performance. There seems to be two major reasons Alphabet's valuation has fallen. Below, I'll take a look at both of those before evaluating whether Alphabet stock is a buy. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet has long been regarded by investors as essentially having a monopoly in search, which has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world. However, that monopolistic advantage now seems to have caught the eye of regulators. Last August, a U.S. District Court ruled that Google is a monopolist and has acted like one through tactics like paying billions to Apple to be the default search engine on its devices. Alphabet is now awaiting a second trial to determine remedies, which could include a potential breakup of the company. It announced plans to file an appeal against the decision. More recently, Alphabet was found to have a in ad tech, as well, including the market for ad exchanges and for publisher ad servers. Combined, those two rulings pose a serious threat to Alphabet, as they could result in a massive fine or force the divestment of key parts of its business. Other restrictions could significantly lower its profit margin, as well. Ironically, the other risk that appears to be dragging down Alphabet's stock is the competitive threat from artificial intelligence (AI)-based search alternatives like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and others. Alphabet launched its Gemini large language model (LLM) several months ago, and its AI overviews in search also offer a response to competition from start-up chatbots. While Google has held its own thus far as its steady growth shows, investors still seem to be fearful of competition. This was evidenced when the stock plunged after Apple revealed that it was considering adding AI search engines, like Perplexity, to its Safari browser. That risk has hung over the stock like a cloud ever since the launch of ChatGPT. Alphabet stock tumbled early in the AI era after it was seen as bungling the launch of Bard, its LLM. To some extent, the competitive threat should negate some of the regulatory risk. However, it's unclear if the courts will see it that way as the Department of Justice still seems motivated to break up the company. At the current valuation, the risk/reward thesis for Alphabet stock seems favorable. A fine would have to be over $100 billion to do significant damage to the company, as it makes that much in profit annually. A breakup seems to be investors' biggest fear. However, even that could unlock some value for shareholders, as the \"sum of the parts\" of Alphabet is arguably worth more than its current valuation, given the strength of businesses like YouTube and Google Cloud, and the potential of Waymo. While Alphabet could be vulnerable to future news on the regulatory front or from new competition, the stock looks too cheap to ignore at the current valuation. It looks like a good bet to outperform. Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: The analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years. Netflix you\u2019d have $642,582 Nvidia you\u2019d have $829,879 See the 10 stocks \u00bb"

    "body": "Image source: Getty Images. Enbridge . The pipeline company plays an important role in the oil and gas industry, and its financial performance is incredibly steady. Management is confident that the company will hit its financial guidance in 2025 for a 20th consecutive year. And that consistency and reliability is crucial when you're counting on dividend income. At 6%, Enbridge's yield is far higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. On a $5,000 investment, you'd be collecting $300 per year in dividends. But that's not all, as Enbridge has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years and has been known for routinely increasing its payout over the years. With strong financials and the company still expecting more profit growth in the years ahead, it's highly likely that dividend income will continue to rise in the future. I'd also put a significant chunk of cash into a stock that has promising growth potential, but that isn't too risky. Alphabet makes for a suitable option here, as it's a big name in tech, has some fantastic assets in YouTube and Google Search, and it has also been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). Due to antitrust issues, there are concerns of a possible breakup of the business in the future, which is why the has been struggling this year and is trading down around 12% in 2025. But it shouldn't be a reason to avoid the stock because investors would still get compensated for any spun-off businesses. However, there's no certainty as to how everything will play out just yet. But buying the stock when others are fearful of it, just as the good old Warren Buffett quote says to do, can allow you to scoop it up for a good discount -- Alphabet stock trades at just 19 times its trailing earnings. For a company that generated $75 billion in over the trailing 12 months, that's just too good of a deal to pass up. This strategy is primarily for long-term investors, and with a long-term view, I also think allocating $1,000 to a bit of a riskier stock with a ton of upside can be a great move. A good stock for this purpose is Green Thumb Industries . It's a cannabis company with a lot of potential to become more valuable in the future. Nationwide marijuana legalization in the U.S. likely won't happen for several years (if ever). But if it does, one stock that stands to benefit significantly is Green Thumb, which has a presence in 14 states and has over 100 retail stores. Legalization would remove inefficiencies, make it easier to obtain access to funding from banks, and allow businesses to transport cannabis across state lines. Green Thumb could also trade on a major U.S. exchange, which could draw in more investors in the process. There are a lot of potential benefits that would come from legalization for the cannabis company. But with investors skeptical about the prospects for legalization, pot stocks have been nosediving. And even though Green Thumb is one of the safer cannabis companies to invest in (it is profitable despite full-scale legalization), it has lost more than half of its value in the past three years. The company's fundamentals aren't bad, but unfortunately, the industry's growth prospects and a lack of federal legalization are hurting it right now. That's why this is a stock I'd put $1,000 into and forget about. You could end up incurring significant losses if things don't pan out, but the upside could be tremendous if the prospects for legalization improve. This is why you wouldn't want to put too much of your portfolio into a stock like this, but it may make sense to at least have a modest position in it. Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: The analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "At the end of the year, Warren Buffett is due to step down as Berkshire Hathaway 's CEO. Buffett has led this business for 60 years and has grown the small textile firm (its original business) into an investment giant. However, he's been a bit cautious lately and has grown his cash and short-term investments stockpile to $334 billion. That's a huge chunk of cash, making up about a third of its market capitalization. Before Buffett goes out, he may look to make one more splashy investment, and it would need to be a big one because Berkshire's cash pile is so large that there are very few companies in which it can purchase stakes without actually buying the whole company. So, he might possibly turn to one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" members to deploy his cash. These include: These are some of the world's biggest tech companies, and Buffett could, with his cash hoard, take a sizable position in any of them. But will he do it? And which one might make most sense? Image source: The Motley Fool. Apple was one of Buffett's defining investments, and he even stated that \"[Apple CEO] Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire Hathaway.\" Over the past few years, Berkshire has heavily trimmed its Apple position, so I doubt he'd buy back more shares, especially at today's valuation. Buffett is a value investor at his core, and he doesn't often buy shares of expensive companies. That pretty much rules out every member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" except for one: Alphabet. Its stock is cheap at , and trades for levels seldom reached. data by Would Alphabet be a stock that Berkshire would seriously consider buying? Berkshire historically invests in companies with strong brands; Alphabet checks that box as it owns two of the biggest platforms in their respective areas: Google and YouTube. With this in mind, Alphabet be on his radar as a last investment opportunity before he exits the company. But he apparently sees one issue with the business. During the 2025 Berkshire annual meeting, Buffett was asked about how many of the Magnificent Seven members have announced massive capital investments to build out their AI footprint. He responded, \"It's always better to make a lot of money without putting up anything than it is to make a lot of money by putting up a lot of money.\" Essentially, he says he'd rather invest in a business that can retain its earnings than spend them. He noted that for many years, Apple didn't need to spend money to sell its products, just typical expenses needed to expand production to meet demand. Alphabet has to spend a ton of money on its data center buildout to stay competitive in the AI race and attempt to get ahead. These investments may or may not work out, and Buffett likely doesn't want to be involved in a business that can't guarantee him a win. As a result, I doubt that Buffett takes a position in Alphabet stock. However, I still think there's a compelling investment case regarding Alphabet and its cheap stock price. Alphabet still has a strong brand, and although it's spending a lot of capital on data center buildouts, I believe that this will be money well spent in the end, as it will allow Alphabet to retain its place in the market as search transitions to AI-powered search. I'd be surprised if Buffett on his way out, but if he does, I think it's a smart move. Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: The analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Tigay is the Portfolio Manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund. Why Tigay Believes That Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Can Overcome the Challenge GOOG is creating its own AI tools, and it will likely be able to utilize these systems \"correctly,\" Tigay asserted. Moreover, the firm has the ability to use the tools to \"make search a better user experience,\" he stated. Consequently, consumers will still see the Google search engine as the best place to obtain the information that they need, the veteran investor believes. Finally, Tigay said that he has faith in GOOG's \"technology and workers,\" as well as its brand, making him confident that the tech giant \"will be able to figure out\" AI.

    "body": "Shares of Alphabet have finally come to life on Wednesday after the company's I/O presentation yesterday. Alphabet announced numerous new AI products and advances that show Google is leading in (AI), not falling behind. After years of worrying about AI disrupting the Google cash cow, the market has turned optimistic, and shares are up 5.5% for the day at 11:30 a.m. ET. Google held its I/O event yesterday and introduced a number of product enhancements like AI-mode in search, Android XR, and agent mode in the Gemini app. The company is leaning into its technology and infrastructure advantages to bear in more ways for both users and developers on Google Cloud. Google is bringing all of its products to AI. Image source: Alphabet. What's most impressive is the breadth of advances in AI, from language to video. And the company is trying to push AI into its existing products like Search and Gemini, presumably before the search business is disrupted by ChatGPT and Perplexity. While the announcements weren't financial in nature, they showed how quickly Alphabet is building product platforms that could drive financial results in the near future. Google Cloud is a growth driver today, AI in search could allow search to grow rather than be disrupted, and the expansion of Android into glasses could be another growth platform. What the market has been worried about for years is Google Search being disrupted by AI competitors.

    "body": "One of the more up-and-coming social media stocks in recent times, Reddit , went down quite a bit on Wednesday. Investors traded assertively out of the stock following an analyst's price-target cut, to the point where it closed the day more than 9% in the red. That was a far steeper fall than the S&P 500 index's 1.6% decline. That pundit was Baird's Colin Sebastian, and before market open he changed his Reddit fair-value assessment to $120 per share, well down from his previous $140. Despite the double-digit adjustment, he left his \"neutral\" recommendation on the shares unchanged. Image source: Getty Images. The analyst's move, according to reports, was largely due to concerns about capabilities being harnessed by tech titans such as Alphabet . Not long ago, that company's core Google unit rolled out AI responses to standard search queries, and it plans to continue beefing up its AI enhancements. To Sebastian, this is a threat to Reddit's user growth, as it can obviate the need for discussion with other users -- the bread and butter of Reddit's business -- in order to obtain an answer. Mitigating this to a degree, the pundit wrote, is a data-licensing agreement in place between Reddit and Google. While that's a legitimate source of concern for Reddit investors, I don't feel it's quite a deal-breaker. We still have quite a distance to go before AI functionalities can even come close to mimicking genuine and organic human reactions, so Reddit's forum-style presentation should continue to be popular. It should also keep attracting new users, adding to Reddit's base -- and providing a foundation for more double-digit percentage growth in fundamentals like revenue and profitability.

    "body": "Although the market has rebounded recently, multiple AI stocks still look like great long-term buys. Investors need to look past the price they have bought them for just a month ago, as those prices are long gone. Furthermore, investors shouldn't sit on the sidelines waiting for another drop, as it may not come for some time. With this in mind, I've got three AI stocks that still look like solid buys and can make investors a great profit if they're willing to hold on to them for at least three to five years. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has been the king of AI investments since the start of 2023, and that outlook isn't changing anytime soon. have processed the calculations to train many of the AI models that we've used to this point, and although there is competition rising from custom AI accelerators that some of Nvidia's clients are designing themselves, the flexibility and computing power that a GPU provides is still unrivaled. As a result, GPUs will continue to be the computing option of choice moving forward. This makes Nvidia a stock well worth owning, and it's still not priced all that expensively compared to where it spent most of 2024. data by As a result, I think Nvidia is still a solid buy here, as many investors made a ton of money by buying and holding Nvidia's stock throughout 2024 at price points more expensive than today's levels. Taiwan Semiconductor , often referred to as TSMC, is a critical supplier of chips and produces the chips that go into cutting-edge devices like Nvidia's GPUs. Furthermore, orders at TSMC are often placed years in advance, giving management unparalleled insight into the demand for chips. As an example, TSMC's existing Arizona fabrication facility has sold out chip production through 2027, which means that it likely has orders at least through 2028 in its system. So, when management is willing to give commentary on what the next five years look like, investors should listen. Over the next five years, they expect AI-related chips to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). That's impressive growth, and is a contributing factor to the near-20% CAGR they expect companywide. Few companies of TSMC's size can put up predictable and sustainable 20% growth for a period of five years, yet that isn't priced into Taiwan Semi's stock yet. At , you're paying a market-average multiple for a company that can reliably put up market-crushing growth. data by As a result, Taiwan Semiconductor makes for a great purchase right now. Alphabet may be a somewhat controversial stock pick compared to Nvidia or Taiwan Semiconductor, as the challenges it faces are quite steep. Investors are worried about how its base Google search engine business will fare with rising AI competition and a potential economic downturn ahead. Additionally, it has been found guilty of operating two illegal monopolies, which could lead to Alphabet's breakup. This has led the market to place a cheap valuation on Alphabet's stock, as investors are worried about the future. data by At just Alphabet's stock is incredibly cheap, but does its cheap stock price outweigh the risks? I think so. Alphabet is currently juggling the traditional Google search versus AI search very well through its AI overviews feature. Furthermore, Google Search's revenue rose 10% year over year in Q1, so if AI were a problem (it has been widely available for three years now), we likely would have seen at least some effect in this area. Alphabet can't control what the broader economy does, but history tells us that the economy eventually bounces back, so the economic outlook is only a short-term headwind for Alphabet. Lastly, the government's investigation into what to do with Alphabet is completely unknown. However, breakups and spinoffs tend to unlock more value for shareholders, and it's possible that a broken-up Alphabet might be worth more than an intact one. Still, we're years away from knowing what Alphabet's business makeup will look like, and the base business is Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

    "body": "In the past year, Google parent Alphabet lost two key targeted at its search engine and advertising businesses. But the tech giant can appeal these defeats, so they aren't the greatest threat Alphabet faces. The larger risk to its business right now is artificial intelligence (AI). Consumers are flocking to AI apps such as OpenAI's , so much so that research company Gartner estimates search engines will see a staggering 25% drop in usage next year. This could cause Google's search business to collapse if the prediction comes true. AI certainly holds the potential to unseat Google's reign atop search engines. In fact, for the first time since 2015, Google's market share dropped below 90% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and was at 89.7% in April. These signs suggest cracks in Google's armor, so Alphabet must succeed at its own AI efforts if it wants to protect its all-important search business. Here's a deeper look into how the company is faring in the battle for AI supremacy. Image source: Getty Images. The AI stakes are high for Alphabet. Maintaining Google's search success is essential because this part of Alphabet's business produced $50.7 billion of its $90.2 billion in first-quarter revenue. Alphabet is determined to win at AI. The company spent $52.5 billion in last year as it built out the infrastructure needed to support its AI ambitions. It plans to up that investment to $75 billion in 2025. The expenditures involve investing in cutting-edge technology to power its AI systems, such as a proprietary Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Alphabet's TPUs are hardware specifically engineered to efficiently train AI models and boost AI inference, which is a term describing an AI's ability to apply what it has learned to real-world situations. So far, its AI investments have paid off. Alphabet began inserting AI-generated results into Google's search results nearly a year ago, and as of the end of Q1, CEO Sundar Pichai noted, \"We continue to see that usage growth is increasing as people learn that Search is more useful for more of their queries\" thanks to AI. Moreover, according to Alphabet management, Google's revenue generation remains at the same rate as before AI was introduced, which indicates the company's addition of AI didn't take away from its ability to earn income from search queries. In fact, Google's $50.7 billion in Q1 search revenue represented growth from the prior year's $46.2 billion. AI is also a central component to Alphabet's success in other parts of its operations. One of these is its business, Google Cloud. Through the Google Cloud platform, the conglomerate makes its AI tech available for other companies to use. Customers building AI through Google Cloud include Verizon Communications and Loews . Because of growth in AI adoption by other firms, Google Cloud's Q1 sales increased an impressive 28% year over year to $12.3 billion. Alphabet's AI accomplishments also extend to its self-driving car business, Waymo, which uses AI to make driving decisions. As of Q1, Waymo is providing over 250,000 passenger rides per week, a fivefold increase from the prior year. Waymo's growing popularity is another example of Alphabet's accomplishments with AI. Alphabet's AI achievements demonstrate it's succeeding with artificial intelligence. Every product the company owns -- representing at least half a billion users -- is using Alphabet's AI now. This is translating into revenue growth with Q1 sales hitting $90.2 billion, up from the prior year's $80.5 billion. And now is a good time to scoop up Alphabet shares. That's because its stock valuation looks reasonable when comparing Alphabet's (P/E) ratio to competitors Meta Platforms and Microsoft . Meta is second only to Alphabet in terms of digital advertising market share, and has also invested heavily into AI. Microsoft competes against Alphabet across the search, advertising, and cloud computing markets. Data by . Alphabet's P/E multiple is the lowest among its competitors, indicating its stock is a better value. A combination of economic uncertainty fueled by President Donald Trump's and the loss of federal antitrust lawsuits contributed to Alphabet's P/E ratio declining over the past year. Although the challenges of economic volatility and ongoing antitrust battles will persist in the short term, these are transitory, unlike the of AI that will play out over the long haul. Despite Google's search market share dipping below 90%, it still holds a massive lead over competitors. OpenAI's ChatGPT is predicted to reach 1% search engine market share this year, but that's still a far cry from Google's share. Alphabet's strategic AI investments are bearing fruit, and its relatively low valuation makes Alphabet an attractive AI investment for the .

The gathering seemed to convince investors that Alphabet's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy was capable of driving growth and protecting its market share.

    "body": "Quantum computing is an incredibly promising technology. It could unlock new ways to solve some of the world's most complex problems. Multiple companies are investing heavily in this arms race, and businesses of all sizes are vying for quantum computing supremacy. While some of the start-ups are intriguing, I prefer to focus on more established companies investing some of their vast resources into quantum computing. Two that top the list for me are Alphabet and Microsoft . Both companies have resources that other companies could only dream of, which is why I think they will end up at the top of the quantum computing arms race. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet kicked off the quantum computing investment trend in December with the announcement of its Willow quantum computing chip. It announced a breakthrough that allowed it to arrange qubits on the chip so that there were fewer errors in the calculation. This is the are facing, as quantum computing has inherent errors. Traditional computing transmits information in bits, either a 0 or a 1. There's no room for interpreting that signal incorrectly, so traditional computing isn't prone to the errors that quantum computing is. Quantum computing utilizes qubits, which transmit information as the probability of an answer being a 0 or a 1. This has its perks and drawbacks. Qubits can transmit far more information about a calculation per unit. On the downside, there is room for errors to develop because the answer isn't explicitly a 0 or a 1. Competitors have made multiple attempts to solve this problem, and each company has devised its own solution. Google's solution was to arrange the qubits in a grid-like pattern to reduce the number of errors each qubit has. Microsoft claimed to have created a new state of matter that allowed the particle to be controlled more precisely in its chip, which gave it far more accurate information. Time will tell which path is optimal, or if both are acceptable solutions to the same problem. But one thing is certain: Both companies have the resources to compete. One of the more popular pure-play investments in the quantum computing arms race is IonQ . IonQ relies on external contracts to fund the company, which it realizes as revenue. In the first quarter, IonQ's revenue totaled just over $7.5 million. For both Microsoft and Alphabet, $7.5 million is a rounding error, and they can afford to throw far greater resources at quantum computing. measures how much cash a company generates after operating expenses are subtracted. Over the past three years, both companies have hovered around the $20 billion per quarter mark, so investing $500 million or so each quarter in the quantum computing business wouldn't be that big of a deal for either company. data by This is a key factor in the AI arms race: The big tech giants can outspend the start-ups. While David and Goliath stories exist for a reason, with how much research and intense computing power are needed to get quantum computing to a usable point, I want to invest in the bigger players for quantum computing exposure. As another benefit, they still have a strong base business to lean on if either of these two loses the quantum computing arms race. If one of the start-ups loses, it's done. This all-or-nothing investment style doesn't suit me, which is why the larger players with more resources are my top picks for the quantum computing arms race.

    "body": "A $3,000 investing budget may not sound like a lot, especially when reading about the massive portfolios of many pros. Nonetheless, some investors have built considerable portfolios on less, making such a sum a good place to start. Moreover, with demand for technologies driven by (AI) going through the roof, investors can still find AI-related stocks with significant potential for gains. When taking these factors into account, investors may want to consider investments in the three following stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Investors will likely struggle to find a company more central to AI than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , the leading manufacturer for all of the top chip companies. Although its customers design their chips, Nvidia , Apple , Qualcomm , and many others depend on TSMC (as the company is also known) to manufacture their most advanced chips. According to market researcher TrendForce, TSMC dominates its industry with a 67% market share. And it shows no signs of stopping, even as it yields to political pressure to produce more chips outside of Taiwan. The company has pledged between $38 billion and $42 billion on this year and will increase its total investment in its U.S. factories to $165 billion. TSMC's growth is so strong that it generated $26 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, a 42% increase from a year ago. That generated $12 billion in net income, 47% higher year over year, as it kept a lid on operating expenses. But TSMC sells at a of 25 despite the rapidly improving financials. That likely means a low valuation and rapid profit growth should help push the stock higher. Investors tend to think of Airbnb as a travel stock and give little thought to its AI. Nonetheless, Airbnb thrives on a strong brand identity, network effects, and a website that links interested parties who need travel accommodations with homeowners. It uses AI to perform many of the required tasks more effectively. Among these AI-driven capabilities is writing a property description based on pictures, providing customer service, optimizing pricing, and detecting fraud. These abilities allow the site to more effectively draw customers while reducing operational costs. In the last quarter, they helped Airbnb book 143 million nights and experiences, an 8% yearly increase. A sluggish economy and more-intense competition have weighed on Airbnb. Its first-quarter revenue of $2.3 billion was just an 8% increase. Also, higher spending in product development as well as sales and marketing reduced its profits. Consequently, the company earned $154 million in the first quarter, down from $264 million a year ago. Still, a sluggish stock performance has kept its valuation in check, and it trades at just 35 times earnings. That is significantly below late last year, when the P/E was just under 50. With this looking increasingly like a bargain, it could spark a recovery as Airbnb's value proposition continues to improve. Another affordable AI stock that investors seem to have overlooked in recent years is Google parent Alphabet . The company is an AI pioneer, having introduced the technology as early as 2001. But the rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI models has called Alphabet's business model into question -- the advertising that supports Google Search and other platforms was 74% of revenue in the first quarter of 2025. The company owns numerous businesses, and Google Cloud has generated an increasing share of its revenue. Moreover, a recent funding round valued its autonomous-vehicle segment Waymo at $45 billion, even though it's never mentioned in earnings reports. The recent report said that first-quarter revenue of $90 billion rose 12% compared to the same quarter in 2024. Also, reduced expense growth helped boost the company's net income, which surged 46% higher to almost $35 billion. Despite that increase, the stock fell slightly over the last year. That allowed its P/E to fall to just 19, making it the \" \" stock with the lowest valuation. That lower earnings multiple and rapid profit growth have given investors the opportunity to buy a prominent AI stock at a discount.

    "body": "After Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earlier this week launched AI Mode, Schwab Network anchor Diane King Hall called the move \"a total reimagining of search\" by GOOG and a \"proactive disruption of search\" by the tech giant. King Hall explained what AI Mode is, discussed why Alphabet is looking to disrupt itself, and noted that the move could have some pitfalls for the firm. AI Mode is an \"AI-powered interactive chatbox interactive experience,\" King Hall said.\u00a0 Internet search produces a great deal of cash for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and the company has been reluctant to \"fully embrace\" AI because doing so \"could put its search business at risk,\" the anchor explained. But the firm has to preemptively combat the threat that it's facing from AI, she said. However, because chatboxes sometimes make major errors, embracing AI also poses \"risks\" for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), King Hall said. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) \"wants to get it right and is looking for a balance between search and AI,\" the anchor reported. AI Mode \"will initially be ad free,\" she noted. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

    "body": "Billionaire Daniel Loeb of Third Point Management is known as a value investor, and last quarter he was picking up shares of beaten-down tech giant Alphabet . Alphabet's stock is down about 13% year to date as of this writing, as investors worry about the future impact of on its search business. However, Loeb has a different view and bought $453 million worth of Alphabet stock in the quarter. Here's why. Loeb wrote exactly why he was buying Alphabet stock in Third Point's first-quarter letter to investors. These investment letters are common in the hedge fund industry and give investors a quarterly update on a fund's investment performance. Portfolio managers will also often highlight a few investment ideas or talk about the current investing or macro environment in these letters. In his letter, Loeb told investors that he made a significant investment in Alphabet in the quarter, while acknowledging the market's worry about AI search and chatbots on Google search. He said that this concern is not entirely unfounded, but that Alphabet has advantages that are being overlooked. The first big advantage Loeb noted that Alphabet has is distribution. While he did not go into the particulars, this can be seen in several areas. First and foremost, the company is currently the default search engine on billions of devices. It provides the operating system for Android devices, which use its search engine. Android is estimated to power around 70% of the world's smartphones. Alphabet also owns the world's most widely used search browser, Chrome, where it is also the default search engine. In addition, it currently has a revenue-sharing search deal to be the exclusive search engine on Apple devices. This gives it access to another nearly 30% of the market not powered by Android. It also has revenue-sharing deals with other browsers, such as Opera . In addition, Alphabet owns one of the world's largest advertising networks. It really can't be underestimated how much time and effort the company has put into developing its local ad presence. While AI companies are still trying to figure out the best way to monetize their offerings, Alphabet can connect advertisers with consumers on everything from a global to a local level. This is a huge monetization advantage over competitors. The second big advantage Loeb said Alphabet has is technology. He noted that some initial Gemini AI model blunders caused investors to forget that Alphabet has been building out its AI capabilities for over a decade. He highlighted that a paper by Google engineers paved the way for the widespread use of , while the company has two leading AI research organizations in Google Brain and DeepMind. He believes that Alphabet is close to beginning to monetize Gemini in a meaningful way. As for the impact on Google search, Loeb envisions a world where generative AI takes content creation costs to near zero, leading to more internet content, whether it be articles, entire websites, or video. However, with this increased content, it will become more difficult and expensive for businesses to stand out and attract customers. In a world flooded with low-quality and fake AI-generated content, he thinks Google Search will become even more valuable as a source of truth. Loeb said he is also encouraged by Alphabet's recent cost discipline and how it is taking a tougher stance on employee protests. Back in 2018, Alphabet had canceled a large military AI project, Project Maven, due to employee protests -- and Palantir Technologies would take over the project as a result. Image source: Getty Images. While there is a Google search disruption risk, Loeb lays out a nice argument as to why he does not think this will happen and why Alphabet will be an AI winner. I also think it's important to note that traditionally the company only serves ads on 20% of its search queries. Even if AI shrinks overall search queries, it could ultimately make them more valuable to advertisers. At the same time, with its large ad network, Alphabet should also be able to find new ways to monetize things like AI Overviews, expanding its overall search revenue opportunities. And of course, Alphabet is also about much more than search. It also owns the most-watched streaming platform in the world and the third-largest cloud computing business. Cloud computing, in particular, has been a big growth driver for the company, and it is investing heavily to keep up with the growing demand for its services. Its robotaxi business is also growing rapidly and has the potential to be its next big business. Trading at a of 17 times 2025 analyst estimates, the stock is in the bargain bin, making it an attractive option to buy at current levels.

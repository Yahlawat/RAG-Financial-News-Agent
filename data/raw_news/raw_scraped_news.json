    "ticker": "MMM",
    "body": "3M Company MMM and Honeywell International Inc. HON are two prominent names operating in the Zacks Diversified Operations industry. As rivals, both companies compete in multiple sectors with significant overlap in industrial products, consumer goods and safety and security markets. With considerable exposure in diverse markets, both companies invest heavily in research and development to innovate new products, drive growth and gain market share. But which one is a better investment today? Let\u2019s take a closer look at their fundamentals, growth prospects and challenges to make an informed choice. The strongest driver of 3M\u2019s business at the moment is the Safety and Industrial segment. Strength in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes, and electrical markets has been driving the segment\u2019s performance. Significant orders for aluminum high-capacity conductors and power cable accessories, driven by growth in demand from data centers and renewable energy projects, augur well for the segment in the quarters ahead. The segment\u2019s organic sales improved 2.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company\u2019s Transportation and Electronics segment is benefiting from strength in the transportation and aerospace end markets. Solid momentum in the commercial aircraft and defense-related business and project wins in the advanced materials business are proving beneficial for the segment. The segment\u2019s adjusted organic revenues grew 1.1% in the first quarter. 3M is committed to rewarding its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first quarter of 2025, the company rewarded its shareholders with $396 million in dividends and $1.3 billion in buybacks. Also, in 2024, it paid dividends worth $2 billion and repurchased shares for $1.8 billion. Exiting the first quarter, the company had $6.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program. In February 2025, it hiked its quarterly dividend by 4%. Despite the positives, weakness in the consumer retail end markets, led by a decrease in consumer discretionary spending, remains a persistent concern. This is reflected in the Consumer segment\u2019s results, which declined 1.4% in the first quarter. There was a particular weakness in the command and packaging expression businesses. MMM\u2019s high debt level remains another concern for its profitability. Exiting first-quarter 2025, the company\u2019s long-term debt was $12.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 10.8% sequentially. Its short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt totaled $1.2 billion. Considering its high debt level, 3M\u2019s cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion do not look impressive. It\u2019s worth noting that MMM\u2019s long-term debt-to-capital ratio is currently 73.1%, much higher than the industry\u2019s 55.2%. The company has also been subject to several litigations, including earplug lawsuits. It has committed substantial funds to resolve these disputes, as ongoing litigation might lead to additional expenses. Per the terms of the Combat Arms Earplug settlement announced in August 2023, 3M agreed to pay a sum of $6 billion to resolve the litigation case over the period from 2023 to 2029. Honeywell is experiencing strength in its commercial aviation aftermarket business, driven by growth in air transport flight hours, higher shipset deliveries and supply-chain improvements. In the first quarter of 2025, its commercial aviation aftermarket sales increased 14% year over year. Strength in its defense and space business, owing to stable U.S. and international defense spending volumes and sustained demand from the current geopolitical climate, has also been proving beneficial. In the first quarter, sales from its defense and space business surged 23% year over year. Solid demand for its products and solutions, led by increasing building projects, particularly in North America and the Middle East, will likely be beneficial for the Building Automation segment. Increasing order rates in data centers, airports and hospitality projects also bode well for it. Also, strength in the Universal Oil Products business, driven by higher refining and petrochemicals projects, bodes well for the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment. Exiting the first quarter, the company\u2019s overall backlog grew 8% year over year to $36.1 billion. HON\u2019s commitment to rewarding its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging. It paid out dividends worth $732 million and repurchased shares worth $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Also, in 2024, it paid out dividends of $2.9 billion and repurchased shares worth $1.66 billion. In September 2024, it hiked its quarterly dividend by approximately 5% to $1.13 per share. Strong free cash flow generation supports the company\u2019s shareholder-friendly activities. For 2025, it expects free cash flow to be in the range of $5.4-$5.8 billion. However, weakness in the Industrial Automation segment has remained a concern for HON. Lower demand for smart energy and thermal solutions has been affecting the Process solutions business\u2019 performance under the segment. Also, the weakened demand for personal protective equipment within the sensing and safety technologies business, along with softness in the productivity solutions business, remains concerning. The company exited the first quarter with long-term debt of $25.7 billion. The high debt level was primarily attributable to the funds raised for the Civitanavi Systems, CAES, Global Access Solutions and LNG acquisitions. Considering its high debt level, its cash and cash equivalents of $9.7 billion do not look impressive. Its long-term debt-to-capital ratio is currently 58.8%, higher than 55.2% of the industry. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MMM\u2019s 2025 sales implies a year-over-year decline of 9.8%, the same for its earnings per share (EPS) indicates growth of 4.9%. The EPS estimates for both 2025 and 2026 have declined over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HON\u2019s 2025 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively. While Honeywell\u2019s EPS estimates for 2025 have declined, the estimates for 2026 have increased over the past 60 days. In the past three months, 3M shares have lost 7.4%, while Honeywell stock has gained 2.9%. 3M is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 17.62X, above its median of 12.03X over the last three years. Honeywell\u2019s forward earnings multiple sits at 20.15X, close to its median of 20.05X over the same time frame. 3M and Honeywell have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, which makes choosing one stock a difficult task. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . 3M\u2019s strength in the safety, industrial and transportation markets has been dented by the continued weakness in its consumer retail market. The legal battle surrounding its earplug lawsuits has created a bearish sentiment around the stock. Also, MMM\u2019s downward earnings estimate revisions for both 2025 and 2026 warrant a cautious approach for existing investors. In contrast, Honeywell\u2019s market leadership position, diversified portfolio, growth investments and strong dealer network provide it with a competitive advantage to leverage the long-term demand prospects in the aerospace and industrial markets. Despite its steeper valuation, HON seems to be a better pick due to strong estimates, stock price appreciation and better prospects for sales and profit growth.

    "body": "UBS analyst Amit Mehrotra recently added Honeywell International to his list of \"top picks,\" which also includes industrials Johnson Controls and 3M . All three have substantive potential to outperform, and these are the stocks investors should be looking at now. Simply put, Honeywell to outperform over the near and long term. The company has already reported on its first quarter, and management raised the midpoint of its full-year guidance based on an excellent set of results. Moreover, the guidance incorporates assumptions for the current level of tariffs. Of particular note is that its aerospace business benefits from the ongoing ramp-up in aircraft production, growth in flight departures, and building automation. Discussing the latter on the earnings call, CFO Mike Stepniak said, \"second consecutive quarter of above double-digit growth in Building Solutions and mid-single-digit growth in Building Products.\" I'll come back to this point when discussing Johnson Controls. There are areas of weakness, such as industrial automation, where customers are reacting negatively to the uncertainty around tariffs, but overall, Honeywell's full-year outlook for 2% to 5% organic sales growth is positive in the current environment. Image source: Getty Images. In the long term, Honeywell's businesses have upside potential from the forthcoming breakup into three divisions. In particular, Honeywell Aerospace will likely benefit from an increased ability to raise capital and present a more focused investment proposition to investors. Honeywell Automation can benefit from a tighter strategic focus as management looks to take advantage of the digital web-enabled opportunity ahead in industrial and building automation. It's a compelling mix and makes Honeywell an excellent stock for near- and long-term-focused investors. Honeywell competes with Johnson Controls in building automation, and the strength in Honeywell's building automation business reads well for Johnson Controls. The company recently released its fiscal second-quarter 2025 earnings results, for the period ended March 31, and reported organic sales growth of 7%. It promptly raised its full-year earnings guidance to $3.60 from a previous range of $3.50 to $3.60, a significant plus in the current environment. Moreover, the 5% order growth helped Johnson Controls increase its backlog to $14 billion. The chart below demonstrates the ongoing growth in installed equipment and services, driven by the increasing deployment of digital technology in its solutions. Data source: Johnson Controls presentation. Chart by author. The company has a number of long-term growth catalysts in its favor, including the added value inherent in the increasing adoption of its OpenBlue suite of web-connected solutions. This suite uses digital technology (artificial intelligence and digital twins) to optimize building efficiency. Not only does this save money, but it also helps building owners meet their net-zero emissions goals. In addition, Johnson Controls' heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems have a growth opportunity from their use to control temperatures in data centers, making the company the AI/data center spending boom. 3M's relatively new CEO, Bill Brown (appointed in May 2024), is already driving improvements at a company that has been underperforming for some time. Previous management's handling of the company's ongoing legal issues burdened it. In addition, an underperforming healthcare business (now spun off as Solventum ) didn't see any significant improvement despite substantive mergers and acquisitions activity, which was also a distraction from its core industrial and consumer businesses. With Solventum now spun off and previous management's restructuring actions starting to bear fruit, it was time for a new CEO to take the next step and rejuvenate the company to its former glory. The early signs are good. Brown is (NPIs) while making blocking and tackling operational improvements like improving its on-time in full deliveries, asset utilization, and operating efficiency. These improvements have come even as 3M's end markets have weakened in 2025, and management believes it is now tracking toward the low end of its guidance for full-year organic sales growth of 2% to 3%. While that's disappointing, readers should note that the operational improvements helped 3M grow its operating margin to 23.5% in the first quarter compared to  21.3% in the same period of last year. As such, if the tariff environment improves, 3M could see a triple positive impact: improved end markets, fewer cost headwinds from tariffs, and likely enhanced earnings as the improved margin performance impacts the bottom line. It's a compelling mix that makes the stock attractive on a risk/reward basis.

    "body": "3M Company MMM has been witnessing solid momentum in the Safety and Industrial segment, driven by strength in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes, and electrical markets. Strong demand for cable accessories, driven by an increase in the construction of data centers and renewable energy projects, augurs well for the segment in the quarters ahead. The segment\u2019s organic sales improved 2.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company\u2019s Transportation and Electronics segment has also been benefiting from strength in the transportation and aerospace end markets. Solid momentum in the commercial aircraft and defense-related business and project wins in the advanced materials business are proving beneficial for the segment. However, weakness in the electronics business, due to lower demand for devices, remains a concern. The segment\u2019s adjusted organic revenues grew 1.1% in the first quarter. 3M has been undertaking structural reorganization actions to reduce the size of its corporate center, streamline its geographic footprint and simplify the supply chain. It expects these actions to be completed by 2025 and yield annual pre-tax savings. In the first quarter of 2025, these actions, together with strong organic volume and productivity, raised 3M\u2019s adjusted operating margin by 220 basis points year over year to 23.5%. For 2025, the company expects the adjusted operating margin to increase 130-190 basis points year over year. In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 41% compared with the industry\u2019s 3.3% growth. However, persistent weakness in the consumer retail end markets, owing to a decrease in consumer discretionary spending, remains a concern. This is reflected in the Consumer segment\u2019s results, which declined 1.4% in the first quarter. There was a particular softness in the command and packaging expression businesses as well. MMM\u2019s high debt level remains another concern for its profitability. Exiting first-quarter 2025, the company\u2019s long-term debt was $12.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 10.8% sequentially. Its short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt totaled $1.2 billion. Considering its high debt level, 3M\u2019s cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion do not look impressive. It\u2019s worth noting that MMM\u2019s long-term debt-to-capital ratio is currently 73.1%, much higher than the industry\u2019s 55.2%. Some better-ranked stocks are discussed below. Federal Signal Corporation FSS currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . FSS delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 6.4%. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Federal Signal\u2019s 2025 earnings has increased 1.6%.

    "body": "Quarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company\u2019s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at 3M (NYSE:MMM) and the best and worst performers in the general industrial machinery industry. Automation that increases efficiency and connected equipment that collects analyzable data have been trending, creating new demand for general industrial machinery companies. Those who innovate and create digitized solutions can spur sales and speed up replacement cycles, but all general industrial machinery companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings. The 14 general industrial machinery stocks we track reported a mixed Q1. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.5% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 1.5% below. Thankfully, share prices of the companies have been resilient as they are up 5.9% on average since the latest earnings results. Producers of the first asthma inhaler, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a global conglomerate known for products in industries like healthcare, safety, electronics, and consumer goods. 3M reported revenues of $5.78 billion, down 3.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.5%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 adjusted operating income estimates. The stock is up 18.6% since reporting and currently trades at $149.40. Is now the time to buy 3M? . With its magnesium alloys used in the construction of the famous Spirit of St. Louis aircraft, Luxfer (NYSE:LXFR) offers specialized materials, components, and gas containment devices to various industries. Luxfer reported revenues of $97 million, up 8.5% year on year,  outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 11.9%. The business had an incredible quarter with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates. Luxfer achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 16.4% since reporting. It currently trades at $11.63. Is now the time to buy Luxfer? . Founded in 1987, Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ: IEP) is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in investment and asset management across various sectors. Icahn Enterprises reported revenues of $1.87 billion, down 24.6% year on year,  falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 29%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates. Icahn Enterprises delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. As expected, the stock is down 1.9% since the results and currently trades at $8.56. Founded with a $2,500 loan, L.B. Foster (NASDAQ:FSTR) is a provider of products and services for the transportation and energy infrastructure sectors, including rail products, construction materials, and coating solutions. L.B. Foster reported revenues of $97.79 million, down 21.3% year on year. This number came in 14.5% below analysts' expectations. Taking a step back, it was a mixed quarter as it also produced full-year EBITDA guidance exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations but a significant miss of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates. L.B. Foster scored the highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The stock is down 7.2% since reporting and currently trades at $18.95. Tracing back to its invention of the mechanical milk bottle filler in 1884, John Bean (NYSE:JBT) designs, manufactures, and sells equipment used for food processing and aviation. John Bean reported revenues of $854.1 million, up 118% year on year. This print topped analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.6%. It was a very strong quarter as it also logged a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates and EPS guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations. John Bean achieved the fastest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is up 6.5% since reporting and currently trades at $114.06. The Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election. Still, questions remain about the direction of economic policy, as potential tariffs and corporate tax changes add uncertainty for 2025.

    "body": "3M Company \u2019s MMM investors have been witnessing some short-term gains from the stock of late. The conglomerate giant\u2019s shares have gained 15.8% in the year-to-date period, outpacing the industry\u2019s and the S&P 500 composite\u2019s growth of 2.3% and 0.3%, respectively. The company has also outperformed other industry players like Honeywell International Inc. HON and Griffon Corporation GFF, which have declined 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively, over the same time frame. Closing at $149.40 in the last trading session, the stock is trading close to its 52-week high of $156.35 and significantly higher than its 52-week low of $96.76. 3M stock is trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating solid upward momentum and price stability. This reflects a positive market sentiment and confidence in the company's financial health and long-term prospects. 3M has been witnessing solid momentum in the Safety and Industrial segment, driven by strength in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes, and electrical markets. Strong demand for cable accessories, driven by an increase in the construction of data centers and renewable energy projects, is driving the segment\u2019s performance. Also, an increase in demand for industrial and electronics bonding solutions bodes well. In the first quarter of 2025, revenues from the electrical, industrial adhesives and tapes markets grew in the high-single-digit range, while the same from roofing granules, industrial specialties and personal safety markets increased in the low-single-digit range. The Safety and Industrial segment\u2019s organic sales improved 2.5% year over year in the quarter. The company\u2019s Transportation and Electronics segment has been benefiting from strength in the transportation and aerospace end markets. Strong momentum in the commercial aircraft and defense-related business and project wins in the advanced materials business are proving beneficial for the segment. In the first quarter, revenues from the aerospace market increased in low-double-digit, and the same from the advanced materials market grew in high-single-digit. The Transportation and Electronics segment\u2019s adjusted organic sales grew 1.1% in the quarter. However, persistent weakness in the automotive electrification market, due to lower automotive OEM build rates, remains a concern. 3M has been undertaking several restructuring actions that include streamlining the geographic footprint, simplifying the supply chain and optimizing manufacturing roles to align with production volumes.\u00a0 In the first quarter, these actions, together with strong organic volume and productivity, raised 3M\u2019s adjusted operating margin by 220 basis points year over year to 23.5%. The company also remains focused on increasing shareholders\u2019 wealth through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first quarter of 2025, it rewarded its shareholders with $396 million in dividends and $1.3 billion in buybacks. Also, in 2024, it paid dividends worth $2 billion and repurchased shares for $1.8 billion. In February 2025, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 4%. For 2025, it expects to repurchase shares worth $2 billion. MMM\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is indicative of its growth potential. ROE for the trailing 12 months is 96.2%, much higher than the industry\u2019s 38.2%. This reflects the company\u2019s efficient usage of shareholder funds. Despite the aforementioned growth opportunities, 3M faces certain challenges that one should consider before investing in this stock. Weakness in the consumer retail end markets has been affecting the performance of the Consumer segment of late. The segment\u2019s sales declined 1.4% in the first quarter. There was a particular weakness in the command and packaging & expression businesses. Lower consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods is expected to hurt the company\u2019s overall performance in 2025. Exiting the first quarter, 3M\u2019s long-term debt was high at $12.3 billion, up 10.8% sequentially. Also, interest expenses in the quarter remained high at $255 million. Exiting the first quarter, its short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt totaled $1.2 billion. It\u2019s worth noting that 3M\u2019s long-term debt-to-capital ratio is currently 73.1%, higher than the industry\u2019s 55.2%. High debt levels, if not controlled, can increase financial obligations and prove detrimental to profitability in the quarters ahead. The company has been subject to several litigations, including earplug lawsuits. It has committed substantial funds to resolve these disputes, as ongoing litigation might lead to additional expenses. MMM also operates in the highly competitive electronics, transportation, aerospace, defense and other markets, comprising well-recognised providers of highly engineered products. As one of its peers, Honeywell serves as a global diversified technology and manufacturing company, with diversified products and services. Griffon, another peer, manufactures a wide range of consumer and professional, and home and building products. Earnings estimates for 3M have decreased over the past 30 days. Earnings estimates for 2025 and 2026 have inched down 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) MMM is trading at a premium to industry peers with a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 18.93X. The current valuation is above its five-year median of 15.98X and has surpassed the broader industry\u2019s multiple of 16.73X. In comparison, Honeywell and Griffon are trading at 20.72X and 10.57X, respectively. Despite its several upsides and solid share price returns, the near-term challenges such as persistent weakness in the retail market, high debt level and premium valuation are limiting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s prospects. While current shareholders should hold their positions, new investors should wait for the stock to retract some of its recent gains and provide a better entry point.

We have a nice handful of earnings results out this morning, but the big tuna in today\u2019s Q1 periscope is Tesla (TSLA), which reports after the closing bell this afternoon. The company has only outperformed earnings estimates in one quarter of the past six, and quarterly estimates on the revenue side have swung to a negative -1.5% since just yesterday. Tesla already reported quarterly sales numbers earlier this month, reporting negative -13% growth year over year, to 336,681 deliveries made in the quarter. CEO Elon Musk has spent much of the quarter in the White House, leading the DOGE policy of laying off government workers and shuttering U.S. agencies. There is also some evidence Musk has been using Tesla as a piggy bank of sorts for his SpaceX and xAI enterprises. Shares of Tesla are -43% year-to-date, but still +60% from this time a year ago. This was one of the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks which rode the onset of the AI trade that started in early 2024. But Tesla now sees intense competition in China among domestic EV companies there, and sits on a glut of Cybertruck inventory here in the U.S. Quickly, GE Aerospace (GE) beat Q1 earnings estimates in today\u2019s early release, by +18.28% to $1.49 per share. Revenues came in slightly ahead of the Zacks consensus to $9.0 billion. Shares are up +4.8% on the news, adding to the company\u2019s +6.9% gains year to date. Full-year earnings guidance pulled back, but the aerospace firm is not being penalized for this. 3M (MMM) also outpaced estimates this morning in its Q1 report, with earnings of $1.88 per share surpassing estimates by 11 cents per share, while matching the $5.8 billion expected in quarterly sales. Shares are up +4.7% in the wake of this release, swinging to positive levels from the start of the year. Lockheed Martin (LMT) posted at strong +14% earnings beat for Q1 today, with earnings of $7.28 per share on $18.0 billion in revenues, which beat the Zacks consensus $17.76 billion (how historically American!) and grew +4% from a year ago. Shares are up modestly, still down year to date. Verizon (VZ) outperformed on both top and bottom lines this morning, with Q1 earnings of $1.19 per share stepping past expectations by 4 cents per share, on $33.49 billion, which took out estimates by +0.48%. Subscriber losses were worse than anticipated, and the stock is down -1.4% in early trading. Atlanta-based homebuilder Pulte Home (PHM) surpassed estimates in its Q1 report this morning, beating on the bottom line by a solid dime to $2.57 per share. Revenues of $3.89 billion posted a beat by +0.74%, though still down from the $3.95 billion in sales from a year ago. Pulte shares are up +5%, cutting its -10% year-to-date level in half.

    "body": "Shares of 3M rose by 8% before 11 a.m. on Tuesday as the market digested an impressive first-quarter earnings report. Sales came in at the high end of the intra-quarter adjustments to , and margins and profits were significantly higher than the previous outlook. On the earnings call in January, the company told investors to expect first-quarter sales similar to that of the fourth quarter and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) similar to that of the first quarter of 2024. Investors were initially expecting organic sales growth of 2.1% in the first quarter, accompanied by EPS of $1.71. However, investors were disappointed in March when CEO Bill Brown told them sales were tracking closer to 1% to 1.5% due to the impact of tariffs slowing revenue growth. On a more positive note, he told investors to expect better earnings. Today, the 1.5% organic sales growth gave confidence. However, the real reason for the stock price surge is the better-than-expected profit margin, leading to a 10% increase in EPS to $1.88. Image source: Getty Images. Management maintained its underlying full-year adjusted guidance of $7.60 to $7.90 but referred to \"additional tariff sensitivity,\" which could reduce EPS by $0.20 to $0.40. In addition, Brown's efforts in margin and operational improvements are bearing fruit with new product introductions (NPI) up 60% in the quarter.  The company's on-time in-full (OTIF) delivery rate also improved again on a sequential basis -- NPI and OTIF are key operational targets for Brown. If 3M can get a little help from the economy and tariffs, then there's possibly some upside potential to its guidance for the full year, especially as the first quarter beat expectations so handily.

    "body": "Shares of industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM)\n jumped 8.3% in the afternoon session after the company reported impressive first quarter 2025 results which blew past analysts' revenue and EPS expectations. Sales rose slightly from last year, with solid gains in the US and China, though parts of Europe and the electronics market pulled overall growth down. Margins improved, too and this helped drive a significant growth in earnings. For the rest of the year, the company expected earnings to grow significantly, even though new tariffs were likely to take a small bite out of profits. Overall, this quarter had some key positives. The shares closed the day at $136.39, up 8.3% from previous close. Is now the time to buy 3M? . 3M\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 17.6% on the news that the company reported strong second-quarter 2024 earnings. 3M beat analysts' revenue, operating profit, and EPS expectations. That the company raised full year EPS guidance was also a great sign. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders. 3M is up 5.1% since the beginning of the year, but at $136.33 per share, it is still trading 12.1% below its 52-week high of $155.12 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of 3M\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $949.31. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

    "ticker": "MMM",
    "body": "3M Company MMM and Griffon Corporation GFF are both familiar names operating in the Zacks Diversified Operations industry. While 3M operates in the industrial, electrical, transportation, consumer and home care markets, Griffon provides consumer, professional, as well as home and building products in the United States and internationally. With considerable exposure in consumer and home care markets, both companies invest heavily in research and development to generate innovative products, drive growth and gain market share. But which one is a better investment today? Let\u2019s take a closer look at their fundamentals, growth prospects and challenges to make an informed choice. 3M is witnessing solid momentum in the Safety and Industrial segment, driven by strength in roofing granules and electrical markets. Significant orders for aluminum high-capacity conductors and power cable accessories in Asia and the United States, driven by an increase in demand from data centers, augur well in the quarters ahead. The segment\u2019s organic sales improved approximately 2.4% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company\u2019s Transportation and Electronics segment is benefiting from strength in the aerospace and electronics end markets. Solid electronics demand, backed by an increase in production volume by electronics original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, is proving beneficial for the segment. The segment\u2019s adjusted organic revenues grew 2% in the fourth quarter. 3M is committed to rewarding its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks. In 2024, it paid dividends worth $2 billion and repurchased shares for $1.8 billion. At the end of 2024, the company had $2.4 billion remaining under the share repurchase program. In 2025, it anticipates a gross share repurchase of around $1.5 billion. However, weakness in the consumer retail end markets, owing to a decrease in consumer discretionary spending, remains a concern. This is reflected in the Consumer segment\u2019s results, which declined 1.9% in 2024. There was a particular weakness in the packaging & expression, home & auto care and consumer safety and well-being businesses. The company expects consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods to remain muted in the near term, which is likely to hurt its overall performance. MMM\u2019s high debt level remains another concern for its profitability. Exiting 2024, the company\u2019s long-term debt was $11.1 billion. Its short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt totaled $1.9 billion. Also, interest expenses in 2024 increased 26.5% year over year to $1.2 billion. The company has also been subject to several litigations, including earplug lawsuits. It has committed substantial funds to resolve these disputes, as ongoing litigation might lead to additional expenses. Per the terms of the Combat Arms Earplug settlement announced in August 2023, 3M agreed to pay a sum of $6 billion to resolve the litigation case over the period from 2023 to 2029. Griffon is witnessing strong momentum in the Home and Building Products segment. Increased demand for its products, supported by the resiliency of repair and remodeling activity in the residential construction market, is driving the segment\u2019s results (revenues are flat on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2025). The U.S. residential construction market is seeing a recovery in single-family housing, supported by lower interest rates and builder incentives, which is likely to be beneficial for the segment in the quarters ahead. The recovery in the commercial construction market, driven by several projects undertaken by customers, is expected to benefit the segment. However, tepid consumer demand for project tools, outdoor decor and watering products has been hurting its Consumer and Professional Products segment\u2019s performance. The segment\u2019s revenues declined 4.2% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Griffon continues to invest in the expansion and modernization of its key manufacturing and distribution facilities to drive growth.\u00a0 For instance, the company expanded Clopay's Troy manufacturing facility, which will improve its manufacturing efficiencies and introduce new product lines. It also expanded the sectional door manufacturing capacity in Ohio to cater to the increasing demand for its premium products. Griffon plans to make additional investments in capacity expansion and technology in 2025. Also, GFF intends to strengthen and expand its businesses through acquisitions. In July 2024, it acquired an Australia-based company, Pope. Pope has expanded its residential watering product portfolio in the Australian market. The acquisition of Pope is anticipated to generate annual revenues of around $25 million and positively impact the company's earnings in the first full year of ownership. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MMM\u2019s 2025 sales implies a year-over-year decline of 10%, the same for its earnings per share (EPS) indicates growth of 6.7%. While the EPS estimates for 2025 have declined, the estimates for 2026 have increased over the past 60 days. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for GFF\u2019s fiscal 2025 sales implies a year-over-year decline of 1.2%, the same for EPS indicates growth of 11.5%. GFF\u2019s EPS estimates have been trending northward over the past 60 days for both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. In the past six months, 3M shares have lost 5.7%, while Griffon stock has inched up 0.4%. 3M is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 15.97X, above its median of 12.03X over the last three years. Griffon\u2019s forward earnings multiple sits at 10.80X, close to its median of 10.58X over the same time frame. 3M\u2019s strength in the safety, industrial and transportation markets has been dented by the weakness in its consumer retail market. Also, MMM\u2019s expensive valuation and downward earnings estimate revisions warrant a cautious approach for existing investors. In contrast, Griffon\u2019s robust momentum in the Home and Building Products segment, growth investments and accretive acquisitions bode well for strong growth in the quarters ahead. Additionally, GFF\u2019s attractive valuation is more appealing and its upwardly revised estimates instil confidence. Given these factors, GFF seems a better pick for investors than MMM currently. While GFF carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), 3M currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .

    "body": "3M has been treading water for the past six months, recording a small return of 2.2% while holding steady at $136.46. However, the stock is beating the S&P 500\u2019s 7.7% decline during that period. Is now the time to buy 3M, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? . Despite the relative momentum, we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons why you should be careful with MMM and a stock we'd rather own. Producers of the first asthma inhaler, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a global conglomerate known for products in industries like healthcare, safety, electronics, and consumer goods. Investors interested in General Industrial Machinery companies should track organic revenue in addition to reported revenue. This metric gives visibility into 3M\u2019s core business because it excludes one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures along with foreign currency fluctuations - non-fundamental factors that can manipulate the income statement. Over the last two years, 3M failed to grow its organic revenue. This performance was underwhelming and implies it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy. It also suggests 3M might have to lean into acquisitions to accelerate growth, which isn\u2019t ideal because M&A can be expensive and risky (integrations often disrupt focus). Analyzing the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) shows whether a company's incremental sales were profitable \u2013 for example, revenue could be inflated through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Sadly for 3M, its EPS and revenue declined by 3.8% and 3.7% annually over the last five years. We tend to steer our readers away from companies with falling revenue and EPS, where diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences. If the tide turns unexpectedly, 3M\u2019s low margin of safety could leave its stock price susceptible to large downswings. ROIC, or return on invested capital, is a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity). We like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, 3M\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased significantly. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between. 3M doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. Following its recent outperformance in a weaker market environment, the stock trades at 18.1\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $136.46 per share). This multiple tells us a lot of good news is priced in - we think there are better opportunities elsewhere. Let us point you toward . Market indices reached historic highs following Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory in November 2024, but the outlook for 2025 is clouded by new trade policies that could impact business confidence and growth. While this has caused many investors to adopt a \"fearful\" wait-and-see approach, we\u2019re leaning into our best ideas that can grow regardless of the political or macroeconomic climate. \nTake advantage of Mr. Market by checking out our . This is a curated list of our stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years. Stocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,183% between December 2019 and December 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like Comfort Systems (+751% five-year return). ."

    "body": "The First Trust Dow 30 Equal Weight ETF (EDOW) made its debut on 08/08/2017, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend category of the market. The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market. Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns. If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies. Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics. This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results. Managed by First Trust Advisors, EDOW has amassed assets over $205.54 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Blend. EDOW seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Equal Weight Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Equal Weight Index is an equally weighted index designed to be a price neutral version of the price-weighted DJIA. For ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same. Annual operating expenses for EDOW are 0.50%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space. It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.75%. ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis. For EDOW, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 18.90% of the portfolio --while Financials and Healthcare round out the top three. When you look at individual holdings, Amgen Inc. (AMGN) accounts for about 3.88% of the fund's total assets, followed by 3m Company (MMM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The top 10 holdings account for about 36.77% of total assets under management. The ETF has lost about -6.48% so far this year and is up roughly 2.91% in the last one year (as of 04/11/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $32.19 and $38.24. The ETF has a beta of 0.89 and standard deviation of 15.31% for the trailing three-year period. With about 31 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers. First Trust Dow 30 Equal Weight ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well. SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) tracks S&P 500 Index and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) tracks S&P 500 Index. SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $541.56 billion in assets, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has $548.46 billion. SPY has an expense ratio of 0.09% and VOO charges 0.03%. Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Blend.

    "scraped_at": "2025-05-23T03:41:26.315814",
    "ticker": "MMM",
    "body": "We recently published a list of the . In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against other best value dividend stocks. Dividends, though sometimes underappreciated, have significantly contributed to long-term investor gains. Between 1960 and the end of the previous year, reinvested dividends and the effects of compounding accounted for about 85% of the S&P Index\u2019s total return. Dividend-oriented strategies offer the advantage of steady income, improved portfolio stability, and a potential buffer during uncertain economic periods\u2014making them a strong choice for all-weather portfolios. With ongoing tariff tensions in the US adding to market volatility, many investors have begun favoring dividend-focused approaches to strengthen their portfolios. After a stretch where growth stocks took center stage, dividend investing has started to regain traction. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, US-listed dividend ETFs recorded average monthly net inflows of nearly $3.3 billion during the six months leading up to January 31, 2025\u2014up sharply from just $107 million during the same period a year earlier. Given the uncertain global environment, investors have increasingly leaned toward more reliable components to maintain portfolio balance. Dividend-paying stocks\u2014particularly those backed by strong fundamentals\u2014have emerged as a preferred option due to their ability to generate stable and predictable cash flows. Since these cash flows play a central role in equity valuation models, determining the intrinsic value of dividend stocks typically involves less uncertainty compared to valuing growth-oriented equities. As a result, such stocks are seen as a stabilizing force within a diversified investment strategy. According to analysts, the strength of dividend-paying stocks lies in their capacity to cushion portfolio losses during market downturns while still providing a meaningful upside. Historically, dividend strategies have shown defensive qualities across different regions and time periods. Data for the three-year span ending December 31, 2024, revealed that dividend stocks experienced lower volatility and smaller maximum drawdowns than the broader market in global, US, and European segments. Notably, when concerns over inflation and rising interest rates resurfaced in August, dividend stocks proved more resilient than their growth-focused counterparts. Historically, income-focused investing often leans heavily toward value stocks, as investors typically look for companies offering high dividend yields and lower valuation multiples. However, a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices points out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index strikes a balance between both value and growth characteristics. Since 1999, the index has maintained an average composition of roughly 60.5% value stocks and 39.5% growth stocks, showing no consistent bias toward either investing style. Analysts maintained that a portfolio combining strong dividend yield, consistent dividend growth, and resilience in payouts should always remain relevant. They noted that even without relying on market revaluation, the combination of income and income growth could support projected nominal gross returns exceeding 10% annually. For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked dividend stocks with forward P/E ratios below 20, as of April 13. The stocks are ranked according to the number of billionaires having stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on billionaire sentiment, we used forward P/Es as a tiebreaker between them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( ). Number of Billionaire Holders: 17 Forward P/E Ratio as of April 13: 17.42 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a Minnesota-based multinational conglomerate that operates in a wide range of industries. The stock is outperforming the broader market this year, surging by nearly 5% since the start of 2025. In the past 12 months, MMM has delivered a nearly 49% return to shareholders. The rise signals growing investor confidence in CEO Bill Brown\u2019s strategy to steer the company back on track. Several challenges are already showing signs of progress, and where that\u2019s not yet the case, Brown has set plans in motion. For instance, the healthcare division was spun off into a new company called Solventum last year. In addition, 3M has reached settlements related to PFAS and combat earplugs, providing both management and shareholders with greater clarity regarding future financial obligations. In the fourth quarter of 2024, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) reported revenue topping $6 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts by $157 million. The firm has recently focused on reinforcing its core business segments, with innovation continuing to play a central role. Investments in exclusive technologies and patents have helped sharpen its competitive advantage. Meanwhile, steps to boost efficiency\u2014particularly within the supply chain\u2014have led to a 70% improvement in suppliers meeting delivery timelines. The company\u2019s ability to manage regulatory issues and ongoing legal matters has also contributed to its financial resilience and investor trust. With a forward P/E ratio of 17.42, MMM is one of the best value stocks to monitor. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) also maintained a healthy cash flow throughout FY24, generating $1.8 billion from operations and $4.9 billion in free cash. During the year, it returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through a mix of dividends and stock buybacks. Notably, on February 4, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 4.3% to $0.73 per share\u2014the first increase since halving the payout in May of the previous year. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.15%, as of April 13. Overall, MMM ranks 6th on our list of the best value dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than MMM but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the . .

    "body": "3M Company MMM is scheduled to release first-quarter 2025 results on April 22, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.77 per share on revenues of $5.80 billion. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) First-quarter earnings estimates have been revised upward by a penny over the past seven days. However, the bottom-line projection indicates a decrease of 25.9% from the year-ago number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues indicates a year-over-year decline of 27.6%. It is worth noting that in April 2024, 3M completed the spin-off of its Health Care business into a separate public company. Notably, the spin-off is likely to have weighed on MMM\u2019s year-over-year top-line comparison in the quarter. 3M price-eps-surprise | 3M Quote 3M has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.7%. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 1.2%. Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, but that\u2019s not the case here. MMM has an Earnings ESP of -0.85% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . You can uncover the best stocks before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. 3M has been witnessing solid momentum in the Safety and Industrial segment, driven by strength in roofing granules and electrical markets. Solid orders for aluminum high-capacity conductors and power cable accessories in Asia and the United States, supported by higher demand from data centers, are likely to have augmented the segment\u2019s performance in the first quarter. However, soft demand in abrasives and industrial specialties markets is likely to have been a spoilsport. We expect the segment\u2019s revenues to inch up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter to $2.74 billion. Solid electronics demand, backed by an increase in production volume by electronics original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, is likely to support the Transportation and Electronics segment\u2019s results. However, prolonged weakness in the automotive electrification market, due to a decline in automotive OEM build rates, is likely to have dragged its top line. We expect the segment\u2019s revenues to decline 12.9% from the year-ago quarter to $1.83 billion. Weakness in the consumer retail end markets, owing to lower consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods, is expected to have hurt the Consumer segment\u2019s performance in the first quarter. There has been particular weakness in the packaging & expression, home & auto care and consumer safety and well-being businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the Consumer segment is expected to be flat year over year at $1.15 billion. The company has been undertaking structural reorganization actions that include streamlining geographic footprint, simplifying the supply chain and optimizing manufacturing operations. These actions are expected to have reduced its operational costs and improved margins in the to-be-reported quarter. 3M\u2019s international presence keeps it exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations. This is because a strengthening U.S. dollar requires the company to either raise prices or contract profit margins in locations outside the United States. For instance, adverse foreign currency translation lowered its sales by 0.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024. MMM shares have lost 7.5% in the past three months, lower than the Zacks Diversified Operations industry\u2019s 9.9% decline. The conglomerate giant\u2019s shares have also fared comparatively better than the S&P 500\u2019s decline of 10.5%. The company\u2019s peers, Honeywell International Inc. HON, Federal Signal Corporation FSS and Griffon Corporation GFF have lost 13.2%, 22.9% and 10.9%, respectively, in the same period. In terms of valuation, MMM\u2019s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) is 16.47X, a premium to its five-year median of 16.00X and industry average of 15.19X. This indicates that investors will be paying a higher price than the company's expected earnings growth compared with the industry as a whole. In comparison, Honeywell, Federal Signal and Griffon are trading at 18.33X, 19.17X and 10.75X, respectively. 3M's robust and diversified portfolio, along with its structural reorganization actions and strength in the Safety and Industrial segment, seems promising for its long-term growth. However, weakness in the Transportation and Electronics segment, along with sluggish demand in the consumer retail end markets, has been concerning for its near-term performance. Also, an expensive valuation warrants a cautious approach for existing investors. Potential investors should monitor the developments of the stock closely for a more appropriate entry point. Therefore, it might be prudent to wait for MMM\u2019s earnings report before making an investment decision. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On Monday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, highlighted how the market has turned upside down, with investors now buying stocks that they used to dislike, saying: \u201cIf you told me this is where the market was headed two or three months ago, I would have thought you were insane, even crazier than I am. This radical transition over the past few weeks has just been frankly unfathomable. We\u2019re now buying stocks we hated and we\u2019re despising, and guess what we are now selling short the stocks that we used to worship. And it\u2019s all happening on the fly. [\u2026] You can\u2019t tell what\u2019s underneath though but that makes it much easier for those real seekers who want to surf the Trump \u2018stock wave\u2019.\u201d READ ALSO: and Cramer centered the episode around the question on every investor\u2019s mind: has the market finally bottomed? \u201cFresh off a turbulent week for the tape, I\u2019m opening up the phone lines and answering your most pressing questions because are we at a bottom? That\u2019s what everybody wants to know. [\u2026] Well, the tariff exemptions, it looks like they\u2019re coming. Market was eager to take a sigh of relief. I\u2019m not so sure where we are with them, but the major indices jumped higher on President Trump\u2019s announcement of temporary exemption on tariffs for phones computers and semiconductors, and really, I guess the subtext is for Apple. But in a tape this volatile we have headlines dropping left and right, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I spend so much time trying to figure out what\u2019s going on, but I think that periodically I nail it. So tonight what I want to do is open up our phone lines to hear directly from you, from the people of America.\u201d For this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 14. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). A caller asked about 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) ahead of its upcoming earnings. Cramer said he expects a decent quarter but warned that large multinationals are currently out of favor with investors. Here\u2019s his analysis: \u201cOkay 3M is going to report in 8 days and I think the quarter is going to be good, but I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s going to care, because it\u2019s a big international and right now big internationals are really frowned upon. But you know what, if you can own it through the cycle again, I think it is a good situation. Overall, MMM on our list of\u00a0stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

    "body": "Industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM)\n will be reporting earnings tomorrow before market open. Here\u2019s what investors should know. 3M beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 4.5% last quarter, reporting revenues of $6.01 billion, flat year on year. It was a satisfactory quarter for the company, with a decent beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates. Is 3M a buy or sell going into earnings? . This quarter, analysts are expecting 3M\u2019s revenue to decline 28.8% year on year to $5.70 billion, a deceleration from its flat revenue in the same quarter last year.  Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.77 per share. Analysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. 3M has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates three times over the last two years. Looking at 3M\u2019s peers in the industrial machinery segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Worthington\u2019s revenues decreased 3.9% year on year, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 6.7%, and Snap-on reported a revenue decline of 3%, falling short of estimates by 4.1%. Worthington traded up 24% following the results. Read our full analysis of and . Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market has been optimistic as of late due to a soft landing. This is an economic situation where rate hikes successfully quelled inflation but did not send the economy into a recession. Furthermore, recent rate cuts and Donald Trump's triumph in the 2024 Presidential election have been tailwinds for the market,   and while some of the industrial machinery stocks have shown solid performance, the group has generally underperformed, with share prices down 10.5% on average over the last month.  3M is down 15.3% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $149.57 (compared to the current share price of $130.21). When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. ."

    "body": "Monday, April 21, 2025 Market indexes closed off their intra-session lows this Monday\u2026 but that\u2019s about the extent of the good news for equities. The Dow closed -971 points today, -2.48%, while the S&P 500 dropped -124 points, -2.36%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fared worst of the major averages: -415 points, -2.55%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 lost -42 points, -2.27%. Ahead of the open we were also trading in the red, but indexes had been climbing toward a brighter outcome a half hour prior to the bell. Investors were keeping their eyes and ears open for possible trade deals announced after a week-plus of paused trade tariffs, but none have yet been forthcoming. Instead, we got President Trump verbally attacking Fed Chair Jerome Powell again, 10 minutes after the regular trading session started, along with a demand for the Fed to start cutting interest rates \u201cNOW.\u201d This seemed to rip confidence in the markets fairly steadily throughout the day, bottoming out a half hour before the close, down between -3.00% and -3.65% before trending northward to end the session. We see that the mere threat of getting rid of the Fed Chair (before his term ends in May of next year) has the capacity to roil the markets amid current conditions. Not only do we still have the draconian tariff levels to concern ourselves with the week after Independence Day, but with inflation data remaining above the Fed\u2019s optimal 2%, either cutting rates in the near term or replacing Powell with a Fed Chair who will is sounding a warning bell among discerning investors. The Gold Continuous Contract (COMEX) closed today\u2019s session up +3.3% today to a current spot price of $3426 per ounce \u2014 new record-high levels. Keep in mind it was only a little more than a year ago that the COMEX hit $2K per ounce for the first time. There are plenty of possible explanations for this development, including Chinese investors willfully avoiding U.S. equities and treasuries as its trade war with the U.S. marches on. Gold prices are also on a divergent path from the U.S. federal deficit. Gold prices are also being assisted by a falling U.S. dollar \u2014 a fact that\u2019s also helping the Euro and Bitcoin make gains on the day. Zacks Strategist Jeremy Mullin told me, \u201cNot sure where bond yields have to go to draw dollar buying, but it seems far off.\u201d Jeremy also suggests the gold trade may be close to near-term exhaustion, and if we cross-reference gold miners, this bears out: Barrick Gold GOLD, Newmont NEM and Anglogold AU are all off highs reached last week. No major economic reports are due out Tuesday, but we will hear from Fed Presidents Harker, Barkin and Kashkari for some nuance on Fed policy following Powell\u2019s comments last week. We were going to suggest we wouldn\u2019t hear much divergence from Powell\u2019s comments, as per normal, the amount of flak the Fed Chair has taken from the White House as a result of his stance may behoove the Fed presidents to tread a bit more lightly. For Q1 earnings, we see plenty of big names reporting Tuesday: 3M MMM, Lockheed Martin LMT, GE Aerospace GE, Capital One COF, among others. But the big name tomorrow is Tesla TSLA which reports after the closing bell. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-based company is expected to lose -2.22% on earnings per share year over year while gaining +0.95% in revenues. The EV major has missed earnings estimates in five of its last six quarters, and its share price has hemorrhaged -43% since the start of the year. Check out the updated Zacks Earnings Calendar here.

    "body": "Industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) in Q1 CY2025, but sales fell by 25.6% year on year to $5.95 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.88 per share was 6.4% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy 3M? . Producers of the first asthma inhaler, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a global conglomerate known for products in industries like healthcare, safety, electronics, and consumer goods. Automation that increases efficiency and connected equipment that collects analyzable data have been trending, creating new demand for general industrial machinery companies. Those who innovate and create digitized solutions can spur sales and speed up replacement cycles, but all general industrial machinery companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings. A company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. 3M struggled to consistently generate demand over the last five years as its sales dropped at a 5.4% annual rate. This was below our standards and suggests it\u2019s a low quality business. Long-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. 3M\u2019s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 14.4% annually over the last two years. 3M isn\u2019t alone in its struggles as the General Industrial Machinery industry experienced a cyclical downturn, with many similar businesses observing lower sales at this time. We can better understand the company\u2019s sales dynamics by analyzing its organic revenue, which strips out one-time events like acquisitions and currency fluctuations that don\u2019t accurately reflect its fundamentals. Over the last two years, 3M\u2019s organic revenue was flat. Because this number is better than its normal revenue growth, we can see that some mixture of divestitures and foreign exchange rates dampened its headline results. This quarter, 3M\u2019s revenue fell by 25.6% year on year to $5.95 billion but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 4.6%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 2.2% over the next 12 months. Although this projection is better than its two-year trend, it's hard to get excited about a company that is struggling with demand. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming. . 3M has managed its cost base well over the last five years. It demonstrated solid profitability for an industrials business, producing an average operating margin of 10.2%. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, 3M\u2019s operating margin decreased by 2.7 percentage points over the last five years. Even though its historical margin was healthy, shareholders will want to see 3M become more profitable in the future. This quarter, 3M generated an operating profit margin of 20.9%, up 2.2 percentage points year on year. The increase was encouraging, and because its revenue and gross margin actually decreased, we can assume it was more efficient because it trimmed its operating expenses like marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead. We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable. Sadly for 3M, its EPS and revenue declined by 3.4% and 5.4% annually over the last five years. We tend to steer our readers away from companies with falling revenue and EPS, where diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences. If the tide turns unexpectedly, 3M\u2019s low margin of safety could leave its stock price susceptible to large downswings. Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For 3M, its two-year annual EPS declines of 6.2% show it\u2019s continued to underperform. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data. In Q1, 3M reported EPS at $1.88, up from $1.71 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 6.4%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects 3M\u2019s full-year EPS of $7.47 to grow 4.6%. We were impressed by how significantly 3M blew past analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter.  We were also happy its EPS outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates.  Overall, this quarter had some key positives. The stock traded up 4.2% to $131.18 immediately after reporting. Sure, 3M had a solid quarter, but if we look at the bigger picture, is this stock a buy? When making that decision, it\u2019s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. ."

This uncertain environment makes it difficult for companies to provide explicit guidance for the coming periods. We had noted here how United Air Lines UAL had provided a two-pronged outlook, with one guidance a reiteration of their existing outlook and the second describing the earnings impact of a recessionary backdrop. Since then, 3M MMM followed United Air Lines\u2019 lead by reiterating its outlook for the year, but also gave a tariffs component that will potentially weigh on full-year EPS in the -2.5% to -5% range. We are starting to see this in the revisions trend, both for the current period (2025 Q2) and full-year 2025. The chart below shows how 2025 Q2 estimates have started coming down lately. The chart below shows expectations for 2025 Q1 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters. The emerging negative revisions trend appears to be broad-based, with Aerospace and Construction as the only sectors experiencing modest positive revisions. Of the sectors suffering negative estimate revisions, the case of the Tech sector is particularly significant as this sector had thus far been enjoying a very favorable revisions trend for more than a year now. For 2025 Q2, the Tech sector is currently expected to bring in +11.5% more earnings relative to the same period last year. This growth expectation is down from +14.2% on April 2 . For full-year 2025, the expectation is for sector earnings to increase +10.2% from the 2024 level, a decline from the +12.1% growth expected on April 2 . The chart below shows how full-year 2025 aggregate earnings expectations for the sector have evolved over time. The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis. While estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven\u2019t been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage.

    "body": "The Zacks Diversified Operations is well-positioned to benefit from solid momentum in the aerospace, defense, and oil & gas industries. Growth in commercial aviation and steady demand in the medical and life science markets are key drivers for industry participants. Infrastructure development, innovation, and technological advancements are also providing momentum. However, Weakness in the manufacturing sector and supply-chain issues have been weighing on the performance of some industry players. Honeywell International Inc. HON, 3M Company MMM, Carlisle Companies Incorporated CSL and Griffon Corporation GFF are a few industry participants that are likely to capitalize on these opportunities. The Zacks Diversified Operations industry includes companies that operate in various end markets, including oil & gas, industrial, electronics, power, aviation, technology, finance, healthcare, chemical, non-residential construction and transportation. Such companies manufacture and provide equipment and solutions, including bioprocessing products, molecular testing-related products, gas and steam turbines, generators, commercial jet engines and engineered fluid-process equipment. Industry players also provide related services to a large customer base. A few companies offer services in the agriculture, marine and telecommunications markets and are engaged in providing environmental and safety solutions. The diversified market operators have a vast global presence, with exposure in the United States, Japan, India, China, Canada and other countries. Strength in Aerospace and Defense Markets: The outlook of multi-sector companies mainly depends on the operating conditions of end markets. Some factors that currently favor the industry are healthy demand from the aerospace, defense and governmental sectors, along with stability in the oil and gas market and infrastructure development. Industry players with exposure in the commercial aviation markets are poised to gain from healthy growth in air transport flight hours. Also, solid demand for several products and equipment in the medical and life science markets bodes well for some industry participants. Investments in Innovation & Technological Advancements: The industry participants\u2019 constant focus on innovation, product upgrades and the development of new products to stay competitive in the market should drive growth. With the gradual development of business models and cutting-edge technologies, several industry players have been banking on digitizing their business operations for a while now. Digitization enables industry participants to boost their competitiveness through enhanced operational productivity, product quality and better cost management. Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Weakness in the manufacturing sector has been denting demand in the industry. After witnessing expansion in economic activities for the second consecutive month in February, the manufacturing sector contracted in March. Per the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) report, in March, the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index touched 49%, down from 50.3% recorded in February. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. Also, the New Orders Index contracted for the second consecutive month, registering 45.2% in March and 48.6% in February. Supply-Chain Disruptions: Supply-chain disruptions, especially related to the availability of electrical and electronic components, have been concerning for the industry participants of late. The latest ISM report\u2019s Supplier Deliveries Index reflects slower deliveries for the fourth straight month in March. Supply-chain issues, if not controlled, might hinder the growth of diversified operation companies, going forward. The Zacks Diversified Operations industry, housed within the broader Zacks Conglomerates sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #85. This rank places it in the top 35% of 246 Zacks industries. The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates robust prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one. Given the bullish near-term prospects of the industry, we will present few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. However, it is worth taking a look at the industry\u2019s shareholder returns and current valuation first.

    "ticker": "MMM",
    "body": "3M recently reported first-quarter earnings and demonstrated that it's making underlying progress that significantly the upside potential for the stock upon a resolution to the trade conflict. As such, the risk/reward calculation has moved in favor of buying stock in the multi-industry company, and it looks like a great buy right now. Here's why. The key takeaway from 3M's earnings report is that the economic environment negatively impacts the company's sales, but it's outperforming expectations on margins and, ultimately, earnings. In addition, the company continues to make progress on the key operational metrics of CEO Bill Brown's turnaround plans. First-quarter organic sales growth of 1.5% was weaker than the implied guidance at the start of the year of about 2.1%. However, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.88 came in ahead of the implied guidance of about $1.71. Moreover, management's commentary implies that this trend will continue throughout the year. For example, CFO Anurag Maheshwari told investors that 3M was \"trending to the lower end of our 2% to 3%\" guidance for full-year organic sales growth. He also said, \"We see upside to the midpoint of our margin and earnings guidance range.\" Image source: Getty Images. He also noted that 3M was trending $0.10 better than its full-year guidance of EPS of $7.60 to $7.90, but management shaved $0.10 off its expectations as a contingency for the \"current environment.\" As such, if the tariff dispute is resolved and 3M's sales outlook can improve, it's reasonable to expect a combination of operational leverage (margin expansion due to more sales volume) and better operational performance on margin (as demonstrated in the first quarter) to lead to upside potential for EPS in 2025. In addition, 3M's progress on Brown's key operational metrics suggests that investors will start to see earnings improvement in the near and long term. First, Brown wants to boost the long-term growth rate by restoring a culture of innovation and releasing new product introductions (NPIs). While it will take time to develop truly breakthrough products, 3M can focus on NPIs like product line extensions. In fact, 3M launched 169 NPIs in 2024 (up 32% over 2023), and in the recent first quarter alone launched 62 NPIS, with Brown intending to launch 215 through 2025 and 1,000 over the next three years. Image source: Getty Images. Second, Brown has candidly admitted that failing to deliver products on an on-time in-full (OTIF) basis has cost 3M sales in the past, notably in the safety and industrial segment. Again, there are clear signs of improvement, with OTIF up to 89% from 85.5% in the same quarter of 2024 -- safety and industrial OTIF was 82%, with Brown aiming for 90% by the end of the year. Finally, 3M's operating equipment efficiency (OEE) improved to 58% from the 54% reported in the fourth quarter of 2024. 3M's OEE figure is still very low and indicates the ongoing potential for 3M to add value for shareholders. It's important to remember that all of these figures were achieved in an environment of weak sales growth; It's a lot easier to improve a business operationally when sales are booming. There's no doubt that 3M is operating in a trading environment with more headwinds than expected at the start of the year. In particular, the auto industry, where 3M has substantial exposure to the U.S. and Europe (auto build estimates for 2025 have both been lowered recently by analysts),  poses challenges, as does another interest rate-sensitive sector, consumer electronics. Image source: Getty Images. Still, a lot of that should already be in the guidance now, raising the prospects that, should the economic outlook improve due to countries de-escalating the trade conflict, or signing the trade deals they say they want, 3M has upside potential for its sales. With the improved margin performance and the underlying operational improvements outlined above, 3M has the potential to surprise investors with its 2025 earnings. Before you buy stock in 3M, consider this: The analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now\u2026 and 3M wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 28, 2025 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Honeywell International Inc. HON, 3M Co. MMM, Carlisle Companies Inc. CSL and Griffon Corp. GFF. Industry: Diversified Operations Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2455922/4-diversified-operations-stocks-to-consider-on-promising-industry-trends The Zacks Diversified Operations is well-positioned to benefit from solid momentum in the aerospace, defense, and oil & gas industries. Growth in commercial aviation and steady demand in the medical and life science markets are key drivers for industry participants. Infrastructure development, innovation, and technological advancements are also providing momentum. However, Weakness in the manufacturing sector and supply-chain issues have been weighing on the performance of some industry players. Honeywell International Inc. , 3M Co. , Carlisle Companies Inc. and Griffon Corp. are a few industry participants that are likely to capitalize on these opportunities. The Zacks Diversified Operations industry includes companies that operate in various end markets, including oil & gas, industrial, electronics, power, aviation, technology, finance, healthcare, chemical, non-residential construction and transportation. Such companies manufacture and provide equipment and solutions, including bioprocessing products, molecular testing-related products, gas and steam turbines, generators, commercial jet engines and engineered fluid-process equipment. Industry players also provide related services to a large customer base. A few companies offer services in the agriculture, marine and telecommunications markets and are engaged in providing environmental and safety solutions. The diversified market operators have a vast global presence, with exposure in the United States, Japan, India, China, Canada and other countries. The outlook of multi-sector companies mainly depends on the operating conditions of end markets. Some factors that currently favor the industry are healthy demand from the aerospace, defense and governmental sectors, along with stability in the oil and gas market and infrastructure development. Industry players with exposure in the commercial aviation markets are poised to gain from healthy growth in air transport flight hours. Also, solid demand for several products and equipment in the medical and life science markets bodes well for some industry participants. The industry participants\u2019 constant focus on innovation, product upgrades and the development of new products to stay competitive in the market should drive growth. With the gradual development of business models and cutting-edge technologies, several industry players have been banking on digitizing their business operations for a while now. Digitization enables industry participants to boost their competitiveness through enhanced operational productivity, product quality and better cost management. Weakness in the manufacturing sector has been denting demand in the industry. After witnessing expansion in economic activities for the second consecutive month in February, the manufacturing sector contracted in March. Per the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) report, in March, the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index touched 49%, down from 50.3% recorded in February. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. Also, the New Orders Index contracted for the second consecutive month, registering 45.2% in March and 48.6% in February. Supply-chain disruptions, especially related to the availability of electrical and electronic components, have been concerning for the industry participants of late. The latest ISM report\u2019s Supplier Deliveries Index reflects slower deliveries for the fourth straight month in March. Supply-chain issues, if not controlled, might hinder the growth of diversified operation companies, going forward. The Zacks Diversified Operations industry, housed within the broader Zacks Conglomerates sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #85. This rank places it in the top 35% of 246 Zacks industries. The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates robust prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one. Given the bullish near-term prospects of the industry, we will present few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. However, it is worth taking a look at the industry\u2019s shareholder returns and current valuation first. In the past year, the Zacks Diversified Operations industry has underperformed the S&P 500 composite. The industry has increased 3.3% compared with the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 5.5% growth. On the basis of forward P/E (F12M), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing diversified operations stocks, the industry is currently trading at 15.51X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 20.37X.

HON and Carlisle Companies Incorporated CSL, which have gained 2.8% and declined 5.5%, respectively, over the same time frame. Let us delve deeper into 3M\u2019s first-quarter results and long-term prospects before assessing whether to buy, hold or sell the stock. In the first quarter, adjusted revenues improved 1.5% year over year to $5.78 billion but narrowly missed the consensus estimate of $5.79 billion. However, its adjusted earnings of $1.88 per share surpassed the consensus estimate of $1.77 and increased 10% year over year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strength across the electrical, aerospace, advanced materials and industrial adhesives & tapes markets. In the quarter, revenues from the electrical, industrial adhesives and tapes markets grew in the high-single-digit range, while the same from roofing granules, industrial specialties and personal safety markets increased in the low-single-digit range. Also, revenues from the aerospace market increased in low-double-digit, and the same from the advanced materials market grew in high-single-digit. 3M has been witnessing strong momentum in the Safety and Industrial segment, driven by strength in the electrical, industrial adhesives and roofing granules markets. Significant orders for power cable accessories in the United States, driven by an increase in demand from data centers, augur well for the segment in the quarters ahead. However, soft demand in the auto aftermarket and abrasives markets remains a concern. The segment\u2019s organic sales improved approximately 2.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company\u2019s Transportation and Electronics segment has been benefiting from strength in the transportation and aerospace end markets. Solid electronics demand, backed by an increase in production volume by electronics original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, is proving beneficial for the segment. However, weakness in the automotive electrification market, due to a decline in automotive OEM build rates, remains a concern. The segment\u2019s adjusted organic revenues grew 1.1% in the first quarter of 2025. Backed by strength across its businesses, the company provided a positive outlook. For 2025, it continues to expect total adjusted organic sales to grow 2-3% on a year-over-year basis. The company also remains focused on increasing shareholders\u2019 wealth through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first quarter of 2025, it paid dividends worth $396 million and repurchased shares for $1.27 billion. In February 2025, MMM\u2019s board also approved a share buyback program, authorizing it to repurchase up to $7.5 billion of common stock. In 2025, it anticipates a gross share repurchase of around $2 billion. Also, in February 2025, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 4.3%. Persistent weakness in the consumer retail end markets has been hurting the Consumer segment\u2019s results, which declined 1.4% in the first quarter. There was a particular weakness in the command and packaging & expression businesses. The company expects consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods to remain muted for 2025, which is likely to hurt its overall performance. Exiting the first quarter, 3M\u2019s long-term debt was high at $12.3 billion, up 10.8% sequentially. Also, interest expenses in the quarter remained high at $255 million. Exiting the first quarter, its short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt totaled $1.2 billion. It\u2019s worth noting that 3M\u2019s long-term debt-to-capital ratio is currently 73.1%, much higher than the industry\u2019s 55.1%. High debt levels, if not controlled, can increase financial obligations and prove detrimental to profitability in the quarters ahead. The company has been subject to several litigations, including earplug lawsuits. It has committed substantial funds to resolve these disputes as ongoing litigation might lead to additional expenses. MMM also operates in the highly competitive electronics, transportation, aerospace, defense and other markets, comprising well-recognised providers of highly engineered products. As one of its peers, Honeywell serves as a global diversified technology and manufacturing company, with a wide range of products and services. Carlisle, another peer, engages in the manufacture of a wide range of roofing and waterproofing products, engineered products and finishing equipment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 3M\u2019s 2025 earnings has decreased 1.8% to $7.66 per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 4.9%. The consensus mark for second-quarter 2025 earnings decreased 1.5% to $2.01 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 4.2%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) 3M is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.49X, higher than the industry average of 15.38X. This elevated valuation could make the stock vulnerable to further pullbacks if market sentiment sours. In comparison with MMM\u2019s valuation, Honeywell and Carlisle are trading at 18.87X and 16.18X. Despite its several upsides and solid share price returns, the near-term challenges, such as weakness in the retail market, high debt level and premium valuation, are limiting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s prospects. While current shareholders should hold their positions, new investors should wait for the stock to retract some of its recent gains and provide a better entry point.

    "body": "From Scotch tape and Ace bandages to Filtrete air filters and Post-It Notes, 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) products are often taken for granted in everyday life . Yet, when consumers run out of them, that\u2019s when their true value is revealed . The same applies to its stock. The company posted a solid Q1 2025, proving itself as a reliable asset whose underlying strength is truly revealed when markets face uncertainty . Unlike the bearish signals from the moving averages on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 benchmark indexes, 3M stock continues to trade above its key moving averages, maintaining the bullish trend that began when the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average a year ago. However, it still comes with formidable risks. Here are four compelling reasons to buy 3M stock and one significant reason to stay out. In the first quarter of 2025, 3M reported earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.88, beating consensus estimates by 11 cents. Revenues grew 1.1% year-over-year (YOY) to $5.8 billion, also beating consensus estimates of $5.76 billion. Most notable is the 220 bps growth in its operating margin to 23.5% and its 1.5% organic growth . The company launched 62 new products in Q1, up 60% YOY. 3M has 215 new products planned to launch throughout 2025 and over 1,000 new products over the next three years. 3M trades at a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.2x, below its average P/E of 21x. 3M has a diversified portfolio of over 100,000 products spanning multiple industries, including consumer goods, healthcare, electronics, safety and industrial manufacturing. Having so many products reduces its reliance on any single industry. During certain economic periods, demand may fall for discretionary products like electronics but increase for staples like Post-it Notes and air filters. 3M's massive portfolio helps it hedge itself by including both more cyclical and stable product lines. On the technical side, MMM stock triggered a bullish Golden Cross on April 18, 2024, consisting of a 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crossover up through the 200-day SMA. The market selloff provided a rigorous stress test of the $124.65 level support , which handily deflected the selling at least four times in the past year. In its most recent test heading into Q1 2025 earnings, MMM bounced off $124.65, clear through its 200-day SMA at $134.35. This is a good pullback level to consider for reentry. The $112.69 level is its Q4 2024 earnings gap fill upper channel support, and the $105.04 level is the lower gap fill channel support. Both levels are solid buy-the-dip levels to consider on deep pullbacks. 3M collects nearly 45% of its revenue, approximately $4 billion, from overseas. A strong dollar tends to hurt selling volumes, like most companies that derive significant revenues internationally. Many companies will provide \u201cconstant currency\u201d results to paint a more favorable picture of earnings and revenue, backing out the . In rare instances when the US dollar loses value, US exporter products are cheaper overseas, which causes demand and sales volumes to rise. The US dollar has fallen even deeper since the end of Q1 2025, which could turn the currency headwind into a tailwind in Q2 2025. A major reason to stay on the sidelines is: 3M admits that will be a headwind in 2025. Tariff impacts would mainly impact its consumer business products division. The word tariff was mentioned 37 times in its Q1 2025 conference call since half its revenues come from overseas. 3M isn\u2019t pausing any shipments currently but has 90 days of inventory, which will run out by the end of June. After that, the impact of tariffs will hit their imports. Nearly 30% of revenues are derived from the Asia Pacific region, and nearly 10% comes from . CFO Anurag Maheshwari provided a little color, \u201cNow, pricing for example, in some cases you can put a surcharge, in some cases you need to come up with a new list price , so we\u2019re working, depending on the situation, keeping in mind that we still--the business is going on as it was.\u201d Management forecasts call for $25 million to $50 million in company-wide losses . Still, other income of $50 million to $100 million could be offset from property sales, investment gains and legal settlements. This could translate into a 20-cent to 40-cent EPS headwind.

    "body": "We recently compiled a list of the . In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against Daniel Sundheim's other stock picks. Daniel Sundheim is the founder and chief investment officer of , a global investment firm active across\u00a0both public and private markets. Established in 2018, the hedge fund successfully endured the COVID-19 slump by relying on an aggressive investment\u00a0strategy based on fundamental research. D1 currently\u00a0manages\u00a0a portfolio of $8 billion in public investments and $12 billion in private holdings. The firm has maintained a significant presence in Silicon Valley, investing in major players\u00a0such as SpaceX, which accounts for about a third\u00a0of its private portfolio. Of course, staying on the winning side is nearly impossible for any investor, including billionaires like Daniel Sundheim. Back in 2022, Sundheim endured\u00a0one of the most challenging\u00a0years of his career as broader equity markets came under pressure from rising inflation. While the S&P 500 sank 19.4%, D1 Capital underperformed with a\u00a030.5% decline, largely due\u00a0to its substantial private-market bets on tech startups, whose valuations\u00a0plummeted sharply. D1 Capital was among several high-profile hedge funds caught in this downturn. However, the firm rebounded in 2023, rising more than 19% after strategically reducing some of its private investments. According to an investor letter received by Financial Times, D1 Capital's public portfolio returned 44% in 2024, driven by strategic investments in European stocks. This incredible run of gains continued into 2025, with the fund gaining 7.7% in January. D1's approach of capitalizing on valuation discounts in European markets relative to US rivals seems to have been largely successful. Speaking on this, Sundheim stated in the letter: \"We believe there is currently an extremely attractive opportunity to buy great businesses that trade on non-U.S. exchanges.\" The billionaire is also a major proponent of artificial intelligence, and believes that public companies represent the best way to capitalize on the AI boom. Speaking in late 2024, he explained that, unlike previous technological breakthroughs, AI would have an impact on almost every sector, prompting companies across industries to invest heavily in its development. Large public corporations, he noted, have the resources and scale required to effectively implement AI initiatives, giving them an advantage over smaller, more agile firms. Sundheim further\u00a0stressed that companies investing in AI today are doing so with a long-term view, realizing that the substantial infrastructure necessary suggests returns\u00a0are likely to come over the next decade, not the next quarter. For this list, we picked stocks from D1 Capital Partner's 13F portfolio as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. These equities are also popular among elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( ). 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a multinational industrial company that manufactures adhesives, abrasives, ceramics, and nanotechnology. On April 24, UBS analyst Amit Mehrotra reiterated his Buy rating and $184 price target for 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) shares. Following the company's first-quarter results and subsequent talks with 3M, Mehrotra raised his 2025 earnings per share projection to $8 from $7.93. This change pushes his projection over the consensus estimate of $7.73. Mehrotra emphasized that 3M's repeated earnings guidance of $7.60 to $7.90 represents a favorable sign. He also noted that the guidance now includes a 10-cent contingency or cushion, which was not previously included. Despite a challenging macroeconomic climate, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) remained financially strong, returning $1.7 billion to shareholders and increasing its dividend by 4%. The firm also introduced 62 new products, a 60% increase over the previous year. Additionally, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) intends to raise share repurchases to $2 billion, demonstrating confidence in its future cash flows and financial stability. Overall MMM ranks 10th on our list of Daniel Sundheim's other stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential for MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. \u00a0If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MMM but trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this .

    "body": "We recently published an article titled . In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed the unease among business people regarding the President attempting to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. While the President has assured everyone that he will not try to remove the Fed chair, Cramer commented that the potential removal along with the tariff policy had created a lot of uncertainty amongst businesses. Starting with commenting on the\u00a0Dow dropping 1,000 points before the open but attempting to rally at the previous close, Cramer stated: \"Actually, that was a really interesting turn. Because no one could figure it out. It was almost as if somebody knew that the President was going to go, now I follow his Truth Social, like I go there like every five minutes. That there wasn't going to be anything today. Uh, there is a belief I think among the executives I speak to and obviously we all speak to a lot of execs, that the President is so off the reservation with this attack on J Powell that, they're not able to really speak about it.\" \"They are emotional. They feel that it's beneath the White House, the President. They obviously are very concerned about tariffs and they all tried to put tariffs in motion, tried to figure out what to do but I was very haunted by the idea that, David, that they feel that maybe the country is not in the right place because they have a tremendous respect for J Powell. . .now, maybe, take the devil's advocate, maybe if Powell cut rates, then perhaps the economy could accelerate. But I think they're taken aback by the name calling.\" With markets being in a constant state of turmoil recently, it's unsurprising that Cramer has commented on their performance quite a lot. In a previous appearance, he advised viewers to be optimistic. One major factor that's driving stocks lower is investor perception of a weakening consumer. However, Cramer has pointed out multiple times that the consumer appears to be strong. For instance, earlier this month, : \u201cI think that the agri-consumer, as long as they have jobs, yes. I don\u2019t think they sit there and say, you know what, there\u2019s coming tariff, I\u2019m going to just disappear. Now you can see these numbers are pulled through. I don\u2019t buy that.\" In another appearance, Cramer shared data from the latest earnings call of one of America's largest card issuers and travel services providers to : \"Uh, I am talking about numbers which by the way include, and we\u2019ve got first twelve days of this month. Steve Squeri going over things, you\u2019re talking about, restaurant spending up 8%, lodging up 6%, goods up 7%, card membership, obviously more and more tremendous numbers have increased. 3.4 million. David, this is as good a quarter if you had to say anything, you would say that the consumer is on fire actually.\" To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on April 22nd. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( ). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 79 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the biggest industrial conglomerates in America. It makes and sells safety, bonding, stationary, and a host of other products. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)'s shares have gained 4.9% year-to-date after dropping by 14% in April amidst the massive selloff. Here are Cramer's latest comments about 3M Company (NYSE:MMM): \"[On policies creating uncertainty leading businesses to consider worst case scenarios and cutting workforce to potentially trigger a recession] Absolutely. And I think that's a very succinct way to put it. I think you go and you look at 3M and the stock's doing well. And Carl, you say, okay what did 3M say? And 3M said, listen we're doing well and the tariffs could be a headwind.\" \"You know the earnings this year, they did point out, they thought it would be prudent to 'hold the estimated impact of tariffs outside of our full year guidance.' . . and what I really want to point out is, Will Brown, has come into this company and he has energized it. And I would get out of this man's way. I would think he is on fire. And I really think it's a great American company and he, maybe you could say that Mike Roman gave him a good hand. But I think if Will Brown's taking this to another level, I think that this one could go up for a long time.\" Overall MMM ranks 3rd among the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

    "body": "We recently published a list of . In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against other best and worst dow stocks for the next 12 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), or the Dow, is a price-weighted index that has long been seen as a barometer of the health of the U.S. economy. After touching all-time highs in late November 2024, the index has corrected nearly 7% in 2025 (as of April 23) and is down 12% from its highs. Rightly so, the correction reflects several unfavourable developments, including economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions weighing on economic growth. The market is expected to remain volatile as the trade and other aspects of the US administration\u2019s policy agenda play out. Amid this volatility, based on the potential for share price appreciation in the next 12 months, we have created a selection of the best and worst Dow stocks from the 30 Dow constituent stocks. If we analyse its trackable history from 1899, the Dow has fallen 7% or more on a single day twenty times. Of those, only seven occurred after the year 2000, and the 5.5% decline on April 5, 2025, doesn\u2019t count as one of those seven, or not even in the historical top twenty. So, technically, this correction was not as severe as earlier. From corrections post 2000, the sharp declines when Covid-19 struck were the most noticeable \u2013 Dow fell 7.8%, 10%, and 12% on 9, 12, and 16 March, respectively, and saw further significant declines in that year. That said, the current period remains one of the most confusing times for market participants, even for the larger players in the equity market, who remain uncertain about their estimates for the broader markets, such as the Dow. In a recent interview, Lauren Goodwin, Chief Market Strategist at New York Life Investments, emphasized that the fundamental picture remains cloudy and investors are still looking for clarity in macroeconomic fundamentals. Despite some positive economic data recently, policy uncertainty is limiting visibility. As more data is released, she believes markets are entering a sustained period of elevated volatility across equities and fixed income. In these testing times, investors should examine fundamentals more critically, preferring Dow stocks with earnings resilience, clear competitive advantages, and exposure to long-term, secular growth themes. On April 28, Stephanie Link, Hightower Advisors\u2019 chief investment strategist, shared her positive outlook on the stock market in an interview on CNBC. With major tech companies, consumer, and financial companies set to announce results, she believes that if corporate earnings remain strong, the recent market rebound could continue. Since early April, the market has recovered significantly, and she attributed the rally to better-than-expected profit margins and steady corporate performance. Although the prominent tech names aren\u2019t cheap in terms of valuation, she views the recent declines as long-term buying opportunities. While markets may remain volatile in the coming months, the best opportunities in the Dow over the next 12 months should come from stocks with strong pricing power and earnings momentum. Investors should stick to stocks with strong brands, recurring revenue models, and competitive moats, which enable them to navigate macro uncertainty. Since the Dow comprises large-cap companies across various industries, these stocks might perform better during sell-offs. To identify the best and worst Dow stocks, we began with the 30 constituent stocks of the DJIA Index. We then ranked these stocks in ascending order based on the consensus 1-year median potential upside. Additionally, we also include data on hedge funds holding stakes in these stocks, utilizing Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 hedge fund database to provide deeper insights into institutional investor trends. It is important to note here that the terms \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cworst\u201d refer strictly to the relative upside potential and do not imply any fundamental strengths or weaknesses of the underlying companies. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 363.5% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points ( see more details here ). 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a diversified global conglomerate that manufactures various products across industrial, safety, transportation, electronics, and consumer markets. On April 22, the company reported healthy Q1 2025 earnings results. Adjusted revenue for the quarter stood at $5.8 billion, up 1.5% organically, and modestly ahead of street estimates. The EPS of $1.88 was up 10% year-over-year and came substantially ahead of street expectations of $1.77. For FY 2025, the company reaffirmed its EPS guidance of $7.6 to $7.9 (in line with consensus at mid-point), including a $0.2-$0.4 impact from tariffs. The company is considering several measures to offset the effects of tariffs, including shifting its production bases, pricing actions, and optimizing networks. Following the results, an analyst at UBS published a report highlighting that the stock remains one of the Top Picks across the UBS coverage universe. Despite the company reiterating its guidance, the analyst increased his EPS estimates for FY 2025. He believes the guidance appears conservative, and there could be further upside to the company\u2019s estimates. Supported by the order trends and better organic growth, the analyst also estimates that the company would win back more market share in the coming years. He, therefore, reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $184. Overall, MMM on our list of best and worst dow stocks for the next 12 months. While we acknowledge the potential of Dow stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods,\u00a0please click here>>> Here are the key points: Uncertainty about the overall macroeconomic picture continues to be a significant drag on the earnings outlook as a whole, prompting analysts to cut their estimates for the current and coming periods. This uncertain environment makes it difficult for companies to provide explicit guidance for the coming periods. We had noted here how United Air Lines UAL had provided a two-pronged outlook, with one guidance a reiteration of their existing outlook and the second describing the earnings impact of a recessionary backdrop. Since then, A.O. Smith AOS and 3M MMM followed United Air Lines\u2019 lead by reiterating its outlook for the year, but 3M also provided a tariffs component that will potentially weigh on full-year EPS in the -2.5% to -5% range. A.O. Smith appears to have used price increases to offset the potential tariff impact that allowed it to maintain existing guidance. Many others have struggled with providing explicit guidance, for understandable reasons. We are starting to see this in the revisions trend both for the current period (2025 Q2) and full-year 2025. The chart below shows how 2025 Q2 estimates have started coming down lately. The chart below shows expectations for 2025 Q1 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters. The emerging negative revisions trend appears to be broad-based, with Aerospace and Construction as the only sectors experiencing modest positive revisions. Of the sectors suffering negative estimate revisions, the case of the Tech sector is particularly significant as this sector had thus far been enjoying a very favorable revisions trend for more than a year now. For 2025 Q2, the Tech sector is currently expected to bring in +11.7% more earnings relative to the same period last year. This growth expectation is down from +14.2% on April 2 . For full-year 2025, the expectation is for sector earnings to increase by +11.3% from the 2024 level, a decline from the +12.1% growth expected on April 2 . We should note, however, that estimates have modestly inched up again over the past few days. The chart below shows how full-year 2025 aggregate earnings expectations for the sector have evolved over time. The evolution of the Tech sector\u2019s year-over-year earnings growth rate is shown in the chart below. The chart below shows the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis. While estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven\u2019t been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage. The chart below should give you a sense of how rapidly this year\u2019s estimates are getting adjusted lower. Given all-around worries about the economy\u2019s growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data. The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.

The bottom line increased 41.5% year over year. Markel Group witnessed solid performance at the Reinsurance segment, improved net investment income and lower expenses, offset by decreased premiums. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) Total operating revenues of $3.5 billion matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line declined 0.4% year over year. Earned premiums decreased 2% to $2.1 billion in the reported quarter. The modest decrease was due to lower earned premiums in the Insurance segment. The figure was higher than our estimate of $2 billion. Net investment income increased 8.4% year over year to $235.6 million in the first quarter. The figure was lower than our estimate of $243.6 million and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $242 million. Markel Group Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Markel Group Inc. Quote Total operating expenses decreased 0.4% to $3.1 billion, owing to lower losses and loss adjustment expenses and product expenses. The figure matched our estimate. MKL\u2019s combined ratio deteriorated 60 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.8 in the reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 100. Insurance : Gross premiums increased 3% year over year to $2.2 billion. The increase was driven by new business growth and more favorable rates within personal lines and programs product lines, as well as international professional liability and general liability product lines. It was partially offset by lower premium volume within select lines of U.S. professional liability product lines. The figure was lower than our estimate of $2.5 billion.

Reinsurance : Gross premiums rose 5% year over year at $581 million. The growth was driven by increases in renewals, new business and favorable timing differences within workers' compensation product lines, as well as new business within professional liability product lines, most notably within cyber liability. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable timing differences and decreases on renewals within marine and energy product lines and unfavorable timing differences within credit and surety product lines.

The combined ratio improved 450 bps year over year to 90.8 in the first quarter of 2025. Markel Ventures: Operating revenues of $1.1 billion declined 1% year over year. Operating revenues decreased at transportation-related businesses and one of the consumer and building products businesses, primarily due to decreased demand. These decreases were largely offset by the contribution of revenues totaling $28.1 million, attributable to Valor and EPI, which were acquired in June 2024 and December 2024, respectively, and higher revenues at equipment manufacturing businesses driven by increased demand. Operating income of $102.5 million decreased 1% year over year. Operating income decreased at transportation-related businesses and one of the consumer and building products, primarily due to the impact of lower revenues. These decreases were offset by the impact of higher revenues and operating margins at one of the construction services businesses and contributions from Valor and EPI.

    "body": "We recently published a list of . In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. In his recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed the impact of markets extending their rally after President Trump\u2019s remarks suggested that his administration was de-escalating its showdown with China. To further assuage market concerns, Trump also asserted that he had no plans to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Cramer remarked: \u201cWell I think that if you go back to Monday\u2019s stock market, that was one of the worst days in my career that I\u2019ve ever seen. I had that comparisons to 1932, a lot of people just saying let\u2019s just forget about this, let\u2019s turn it off, I don\u2019t want to be in this anymore. David, there seemed to me on Monday to be a belief that we\u2019re really on our own, do whatever you want, tariff away, we don\u2019t need anybody, interest rates going the wrong way, gold going the wrong way. It was just a hideous day.\u201d Given that Cramer has interacted with the markets in one form or the other before most of us were born, naturally his remarks about Monday being the worst of his career raised eyebrows. Co-host David Faber refused to believe it and asked Cramer whether he really did think that it was the all-time worst day. In response, Cramer clarified that it was the worst day in terms of despair. \u201cNo, because in terms of despair. Despair. Level of despair. . .Just saying the level of despair on Monday when I left,\u201d he said. Cramer also outlined that those who had predicted that a bear market was in play were proven wrong.\u00a0\u201cEveryone said bear market rally yesterday, well you know those people have been pantsed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a guy on this morning . .was talking about tariffs, you know I was really hammered. I said jeez you know it\u2019s early in the morning,\u201d Cramer added. However, even though the bears were \u2018pantsed,\u2019 it didn\u2019t mean that the performance was stellar. Commenting on JPMorgan calling recent market events a wholesale divorce from dollar-denominated assets, Cramer outlined: \u201cI felt like I could go very easily into pretty much any market in the world and be better than ours.\u201d The CNBC host also shared that Treasury Secretary Bessent appears to be driving the policy, as for now. According to him: \u201cI think that Bessent, Treasury Secretary Bessent, is regarded as being at the tiller, right now. And he understands the stock market. And there\u2019s, Navarro, who understands death by China.\u201d Commenting on the link between Bessent and President Trump, Cramer shared: \u201cLook obviously he [Bessent] just knows there\u2019s some connection between the stock market and the country. And I know that the President, first go around, regarded as being really important. In the second go around he\u2019s just said basically it\u2019s an abstraction even to the point where I can do tariffs higher than Smoot-Hawley and not care what happens.\u201d To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on April 23rd. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( ). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 79 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the biggest industrial conglomerates in the world. Its shares have gained 7% year-to-date despite the fact that they tumbled by 14% in early April. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) has benefited from several factors such as a robust earnings report which saw the firm\u2019s first quarter profit-per-share of $1.88 beat analyst estimates of $1.77. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about 3M Company (NYSE:MMM): \u201cI think that 3M the other day, is back. They\u2019ve got that company together. . . .these companies have all kind of said, you know we\u2019re not hurt that much by tariffs. We\u2019re doing pretty well. And then you start getting a narrative which says maybe no recession.\u201d Overall, MMM on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a benchmark index of the top 30 companies in the US. It represents the strength of the US economy and carries great historical significance as well. It also acts as a reference point for analysts and investors. However, not all stocks within this elite group of companies perform equally. While some thrive on innovation and economic boom, others struggle due to various setbacks and economic trends. We decided to break down the index and find out the best and worst stocks, looking at what was making them perform unexpectedly this year. In order to come up with our ranking of the best and worst Dow stocks, we first assigned a rank to each stock based on the number of hedge funds holding the stock. We then looked at the short interest in each stock and assigned the top rank to the company with the least short interest. We then combined the two ranks to see which stock was the best on average. The list is in ascending order, with the best stock taking the number one spot. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( ). Short Interest as of Apr 30, 2025: 1.91% 3M Company operates as a diversified technology services provider. The company generates revenue through Consumer, Transportation and Electronics, and Safety and Industrial segments. MMM started 2025 with a bullish outlook as analysts at financial services firm Wells Fargo upgraded it from Equal Weight to Overweight. Wells Fargo also increased the price target from $140 to $170, pointing out that the company was well-positioned to improve profit margins and continue share buybacks. Joseph O\u2019Dea, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said: \u201cAfter the largest restructuring program in 3M\u2019s history, there\u2019s still a significant cost opportunity ahead to drive better operational execution. If demand accelerates, 3M will benefit and cost out will drive strong incrementals. But if demand underwhelms, earnings growth potential remains attractive at 3M.\u201d Looking ahead to 2025, the company reaffirmed its FY 2025 outlook regardless of macroeconomic uncertainties. Management anticipates adjusted EPS ranging between $7.60 to $7.9. Backed by a $7.5 billion authorization, CEO Bill Brown announced plans to buy back $2 billion in shares in 2025, beating previous estimates of $1.5 billion. Overall, MMM on our list of best and worst Dow stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MMM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this . . Disclosure: None.
